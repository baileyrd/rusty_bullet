//! Rocket League's real standard-arena field dimensions
//! (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-019`), and a constructor for its octagonal
//! footprint plus a ceiling — built entirely from the existing generic
//! `StaticPlane`/`PhysicsWorld::with_wall` machinery `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-013`
//! already provides. No new collision code: a ceiling and a corner-cut wall
//! are each just another flat `StaticPlane`, the same as the ground or a
//! side wall.
//!
//! `standard_curves` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-020`/`FR-021`/`FR-022`) adds curved
//! fillets throughout the arena's vertical boundary — wall-to-floor/
//! wall-to-ceiling seams for all 9 walls (the 4 cardinal walls and, since
//! FR-021, the 4 diagonal corner walls too), and, since FR-022, a fillet at
//! each of the 8 vertical edges where a corner wall meets its neighboring
//! side/back wall — all built from `body::StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes`
//! — still no new collision code of its own here, just composing the same
//! flat planes `standard_walls` already builds. `between_planes` itself
//! generalized (as part of FR-022) to handle any two non-parallel planes,
//! not just perpendicular ones, so this module never needed its own
//! geometry code for the corner walls' shallower (135-degree) vertical
//! edges — only which two planes to bridge, and a plain `(0, 0, 1)` axis
//! direction (the edge itself is vertical), differ from the floor/
//! ceiling-seam case.
//!
//! `standard_corner_fillets` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-023`) adds a small
//! spherical patch at each of the 16 compound-corner vertices where a
//! vertical-edge fillet meets a floor- or ceiling-seam fillet, near a
//! corner wall's own top/bottom endpoint — built from
//! `body::StaticCornerFillet::between_three_planes` on the same three flat
//! planes (floor/ceiling, side/back wall, corner wall) that meet there,
//! rather than the two `standard_curves`' own fillets each bridge.
//!
//! Since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-025`, a corner wall's own floor/ceiling-seam
//! arches (the 8 of `standard_curves`' 24 fillets bridging a corner wall to
//! the floor or ceiling) use the corner walls' own `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS`
//! rather than the cardinal walls' `FILLET_RADIUS`, matching real Rocket
//! League's bigger, more swept corner-boost curve. All 16
//! `standard_corner_fillets` also switch to `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS`, since each
//! one touches one of those arches and `between_three_planes` needs one
//! shared radius across all three planes it blends to still meet the arch
//! exactly where their axes cross (see `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS`'s own doc
//! comment). The 8 vertical-edge fillets where a corner wall meets its
//! neighboring side/back wall are unaffected — they're independent,
//! additive contact sources next to these arches, not blended with them,
//! same as every other adjoining-fillet pair in this module — and keep
//! `FILLET_RADIUS`.
//!
//! `standard_goal_walls` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-024`) open an actual
//! goal-mouth window in each back wall — until then, `standard_walls`' two
//! back walls were solid, flat planes spanning the full width, with no
//! opening at all. `standard_walls` itself returns 7 planes instead of 9
//! (the back walls move out of it, replaced by `standard_goal_walls`'
//! `StaticGoalWall`s). The window's edges are *not* filleted: `FR-024`'s
//! six `FILLET_RADIUS` edge fillets and `FR-026`'s four compound-corner
//! fillets were withdrawn by `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-085` (finding C) — built
//! from the back wall's field-facing plane and the post's inward-facing
//! plane, each one was a concave `292` uu gutter standing *in front of*
//! the wall beside the goal, and the second capture session's real car
//! drives straight through that footprint (`x ∈ [894, 992]`,
//! `y ∈ [4838, 5120]`) onto a flat back wall and up it. The real goal
//! frame's rounding, if any, is below what a capture can resolve; the
//! window is a clean cut until a capture says otherwise.
//!
//! Since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027`, a car (box) is actually deflected by
//! every fillet in this module too — `collision::contacts_vs_quarter_pipe`/
//! `contacts_vs_corner_fillet` test a box's own 8 corners against the
//! curved surface (the same technique `contacts_vs_plane`'s box path
//! already used for a flat plane), an approximation of the box as a whole,
//! not a full convex-vs-curved-surface narrow phase — see
//! `collision::box_vs_quarter_pipe`'s own doc comment for exactly what
//! that does and doesn't catch.
//!
//! Since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-028`, a car can drive into a goal too —
//! `collision::contacts_vs_goal_wall`'s box path now tests each of the
//! box's own 8 corners against the window (the same per-corner approach
//! FR-027 established for curved geometry), rather than falling straight
//! through to an unwindowed plane contact the way it did through FR-027.
//!
//! `standard_goal_back_walls`/`standard_goal_side_walls`/`standard_goal_roofs`
//! (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`) model a bounded interior behind each
//! goal-mouth window, closing the "a ball or car passes into open,
//! unbounded space" gap FR-024 through FR-028's own doc comments flagged —
//! 2 plain back-of-net planes (`goal_back_wall_plane`, `GOAL_DEPTH` behind
//! the real back wall, reachable only through the window so an unbounded
//! plane there is exact, not an approximation) plus 4 bounded side walls
//! and 2 bounded roofs (`goal_side_wall`/`goal_roof`, each a
//! `body::StaticBoundedWall` reusing `goal_post_plane`/`goal_crossbar_plane`
//! unchanged but bounded to the goal's own depth/width/height footprint —
//! an unbounded plane at either position would incorrectly wall off the
//! *entire* main field, the same problem those planes' own doc comments
//! already documented for their original, purely-geometric role).
//!
//! Since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-033`, each goal also gets a real mass-spring net
//! panel (`standard_nets`, a `net::NetMesh` each, `NET_DEPTH` behind the
//! real back wall — well in front of `goal_back_wall_plane`'s own rigid
//! backstop, unchanged) catching the *ball* — see `net::NetMesh`'s own doc
//! comment for the design and for what's still explicitly out of scope
//! (a car's own contact against the net, a full 3D "sock" shape, bending
//! stiffness).
//!
//! **Still not modeled**: any geometry finer than a single flat plane,
//! single-radius edge fillet, or single-radius corner fillet per boundary
//! segment (the real field mesh's corners and transitions are more complex
//! than this). See `RB-PHYSICS-001`'s Non-goals.
