//! A genuine mass-spring net panel (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-033`), replacing
//! part of `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`'s solid-bounding-box stand-in with real
//! springy/catching behavior for the ball — the "ball tangles in netting"
//! case `RB-PHYSICS-001`'s own Non-goals had explicitly deferred ever since
//! FR-029 shipped.
//!
//! `NetMesh` is a rectangular grid of point masses (`points`, each a tiny
//! `RigidBody::sphere` — reusing this crate's existing rigid-body/collision/
//! solver machinery rather than inventing a bespoke penalty-force system)
//! connected by structural (horizontal/vertical) and shear (diagonal)
//! springs (`springs`, Hooke's law plus velocity damping along each
//! spring's own axis). Every point on the grid's own perimeter is anchored
//! (`anchored[i] == true`) — fixed in place, representing the net's real
//! attachment to the rigid goal frame (crossbar, both posts, and the
//! ground/back line) — while every interior point is free to move under
//! gravity, spring forces, and ball contact.
//!
//! `NetMesh::step` advances the net's own internal physics by the caller's
//! `dt`, split into `NET_SUBSTEPS` smaller sub-steps (a mass-spring system
//! this stiff would go numerically unstable integrated with Bullet's own
//! typical single-step `dt` values, e.g. 1/60s) and resolves every body's
//! contact against every free point it currently overlaps via
//! `collision::sphere_vs_sphere`/`solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` (since
//! `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050` — see `step`'s own doc comment) — the same
//! two-dynamic-body sequential-impulse machinery every other dynamic-vs-
//! dynamic contact in this crate already uses (ball-vs-car, car-vs-car),
//! not a special-cased shortcut. This is why a net point is a real (if
//! artificially tiny and light) `RigidBody` rather than a plain `Vec3`
//! position/velocity pair: it lets this module add zero new solver code,
//! only the spring-force accumulation Hooke's law itself needs and the
//! sphere-vs-sphere contact test this crate had no prior caller for (see
//! `collision::sphere_vs_sphere`'s own doc comment).
//!
//! `NET_POINT_MASS`, `NET_POINT_RADIUS`, `NET_SPRING_CONSTANT`,
//! `NET_SPRING_DAMPING`, `NET_LINEAR_DAMPING`, `NET_RESTITUTION`, and
//! `NET_FRICTION` are all uncalibrated placeholders, the same
//! "no public reference exists for this, tuned empirically for stable,
//! plausible behavior" category `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s audit already
//! flagged several other constants under (e.g. the former `drive::STEER_TORQUE`, retired by `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-082`)
//! — real Rocket League's actual net material properties have never been
//! published, and even if they had, this port's own point-mass/spring
//! topology is already a simplification of a real net's continuum cloth
//! behavior, so a "correct" numeric match isn't really a coherent target
//! yet. `NET_RESTITUTION` is deliberately low (the net *catches*, it
//! doesn't bounce the ball back out) and `NET_FRICTION` deliberately high
//! (grippy netting), matching the qualitative behavior a real net has
//! without claiming either number is measured.
//!
//! Since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-038`, `step` takes every body that can touch the
//! net (the ball and every car, via a `&mut [RigidBody]` slice) rather than
//! the ball alone — a car is resolved against every free point exactly the
//! same way the ball always was (`collision::contacts_between`, dispatching
//! to the same box-vs-sphere path
//! `ball_bounces_off_a_stationary_car_instead_of_passing_through` already
//! exercises for ball-vs-car), closing the "a car still passes through
//! untouched" gap this module's own doc comment used to carry as an
//! explicit Non-goal.
//!
//! Explicitly still out of scope (tracked in `RB-PHYSICS-001`, not silently
//! dropped): manifold richness beyond one contact per overlapping point per
//! body (no clipped-face-style manifold the way `box_vs_box` builds one); a
//! full 3D "sock" shape billowing backward from the goal mouth (this models
//! a single flat rest-shape panel instead, which still deforms backward
//! dynamically under a real impact via its own springs — just not a
//! pre-shaped pocket); and bending stiffness (only structural + shear
//! springs, no springs resisting the mesh folding along a diagonal) — none
//! of this crate's existing cloth-adjacent shapes need rendering-quality
//! draping, only enough structure to catch a ball or car believably.
