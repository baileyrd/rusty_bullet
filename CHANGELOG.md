## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Repo lifecycle bootstrap: charter, system architecture, spec tree
  (`RB-VERIFY-001/002/003`, `RB-PHYSICS-001`, `RB-SIM-001`, `RB-NET-001`),
  ADR-0001..0003, research backlog, roadmap, traceability, AGENTS.md,
  WORKFLOW.md, and the standard governance file set.
- Cargo workspace (`rb_domain`, `rb_replay_ingest`, `rb_capture_ingest`,
  `rb_verify_cli`) with a working, unit-tested divergence-scoring algorithm
  and stubbed ingestion adapters.
- `rb_physics_bullet`: a Rust port of Bullet3's rigid-body integration and
  sequential-impulse contact solver, scoped to a dynamic sphere vs. a
  static plane (ADR-0004). Vector/quaternion algebra added to
  `rb_domain::state`.
- `rb_replay_ingest`: real `.replay` parsing via `boxcars` + `subtr-actor`
  (`RB-VERIFY-001-FR-001/002/003`), verified against a vendored real
  replay fixture.
- `rb_replay_ingest`: `corpus_check` bin, a local/gitignored-corpus health
  check (`RB-VERIFY-001-NFR-003`) — validated against 40 of the owner's
  real match replays (40/40 clean), closing the "runs correctly on real
  owner data at scale" half of `RB-VERIFY-001`'s owner-data acceptance
  criterion.
- `rb_domain::ControllerInput` and `CarState.input` (ADR-0005), a shared
  controller-input schema; `rb_replay_ingest` now attaches recovered input
  to every car (`RB-VERIFY-001-FR-004`).
- `rb_capture_ingest`: real capture-file parsing via a new JSON-Lines
  format (`RB-VERIFY-002-FR-002`/`NFR-001`, ADR-0005), verified against a
  synthetic fixture and, now that the BakkesMod-side plugin is built, a
  real capture too.
- `bakkesmod-plugin/rusty_bullet_capture/`: the BakkesMod-side capture
  plugin's C++ source (`RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`), grounded against a real
  `BakkesModSDK` clone and emitting ADR-0005's JSON-Lines format. Outside
  the Cargo workspace and this repo's CI (Windows/BakkesMod/Rocket League
  only). Built with MSVC + CMake, loaded into a real Rocket League +
  BakkesMod session, and run in freeplay; a real capture caught and fixed a
  bug where cars were enumerated via a PRI back-reference that's never
  updated in freeplay, switched to `ServerWrapper::GetCars()` instead.
- `rb_verify_cli`: `score_replay_against_capture`, wiring ingestion to
  `rb_domain::divergence::score`. Manually run end-to-end against a real
  replay fixture and a capture file; not yet a fidelity measurement.
- Ran `rb_verify_cli` end-to-end against the real vendored replay fixture
  and a real BakkesMod capture for the first time (343 frames compared,
  mean ball distance 3640.81 uu, mean car position/rotation/velocity
  distance 4714.78 uu / 2.31 rad / 2127.93 uu/s), closing `PHASE-0-EXIT`'s
  literal exit criterion and all four `PHASE-0-*` roadmap units. Not a
  fidelity measurement — the replay and capture are unrelated matches;
  that needs a Phase 1 candidate engine that doesn't exist yet.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-076`: `rb_physics_bullet` can now seed a
  `PhysicsWorld` from a recorded `PhysicsFrame` (`PhysicsWorld::from_frame`)
  and simulate it forward using a recorded per-tick controller-input
  sequence (`world::simulate_recorded`) — the candidate-engine plumbing
  `FR-005`'s real-data calibration needs. Along the way, fetched
  RocketSim's own real car mass/hitbox and ball mass
  (`body::CAR_MASS`/`CAR_HALF_EXTENTS`/`BALL_MASS`, new
  `RigidBody::standard_car`/`standard_ball`), surfacing a real ~44% width
  discrepancy in this crate's own long-standing car hitbox test
  placeholder. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077` wires that capability into
  `rb_verify_cli`: `score_capture_against_candidate` seeds a
  `PhysicsWorld` from a capture's own first grounded, neutral frame
  (`is_grounded_and_neutral`) and scores a candidate simulated from that
  capture's own recorded input against its own recorded outcome — this
  project's first fidelity comparison with a genuine physical reason to
  be small if the physics core is accurate — exposed via a new `rb-verify
  --self <capture-file>` CLI mode. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-078` then retuned
  every existing test that models a real car (across
  `body.rs`/`collision.rs`/`drive.rs`/`net.rs`/`solver.rs`/`world.rs`)
  from that old placeholder to `CAR_HALF_EXTENTS`, closing the
  discrepancy FR-076 had deliberately left open — no test count change,
  all 335 `rb_physics_bullet` tests still pass. The owner then ran
  `rb-verify --self` against the real capture on their own machine,
  producing this project's first genuine fidelity number (2,818 frames:
  mean ball distance 2206.08 uu, mean car position/rotation/velocity
  distance 4508.71 uu / 2.12 rad / 1421.73 uu/s) — a large divergence
  consistent with near-total trajectory decorrelation over the run's own
  ~23-second span, not yet the right shape of evidence to calibrate
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`'s constants from (see that spec's own
  Interpretation note). The recommended follow-up — a diagnostic into how
  that divergence grows *within* the run, not just its whole-run total —
  is now implemented as `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-004`: a windowed
  `rb_domain::divergence::score_windows` (sharing a `matched_pairs`/
  `score_pairs` pipeline with the existing `score`, so the two can't
  drift apart) and a new `rb-verify --self-growth` CLI mode. Run for real
  against `FR-077`'s own `test2.jsonl`: the divergence is **abrupt**, not
  gradual — near-perfect for ~4 seconds, then a sharp derailment
  coinciding with a diagonal dodge in the recorded input, after which the
  trajectories fluctuate in a bounded range rather than growing further.
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079` then replayed that exact dodge in isolation,
  seeded fresh from the real recorded state right before it (a new real
  fixture, `dodge-derailment.capture.jsonl`) — confirming the maneuver as
  the proximate cause and refining the hypothesis: an orientation-rate
  divergence begins smoothly during the grounded jump hold, *before* the
  dodge fires, which the dodge's own orientation-relative impulse then
  amplifies into a translation kick pointing in a different world
  direction than the recording's, on top of a likely-separate post-dodge
  spin-rate mismatch matching `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s already-
  documented, unimplemented continuous flip torque. That pre-dodge
  divergence has since been traced to its own mechanism: RocketSim's real
  `Car.cpp::_UpdateAirTorque` (and its dodge-torque/autoroll-torque call
  sites) pre-multiply by the car's own actual inertia tensor to cancel
  Bullet's inverse-inertia integration step, making `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`
  an inertia-independent direct angular-acceleration input in real Rocket
  League — while this port's own `apply_torque`/`integrate.rs` divide by
  the car's actual moment of inertia as usual, silently under-applying it.
  Confirmed quantitatively (predicted `≈2.211` rad/s² vs. measured `≈2.2`
  rad/s² candidate yaw acceleration, vs. `≈9.12` rad/s² for the real car).
  A naive uniform `≈4.15x` rescale of the constant was tried and rejected
  — it helps yaw but hurts pitch/roll, confirming the mismatch is
  architectural, not a scalar miscalibration. That architectural fix is
  now implemented: `RigidBody` gained a second, inertia-independent
  accumulator (`apply_angular_acceleration`/`total_angular_accel`,
  integrated with no `inv_inertia_world` multiply), and `drive.rs`'s air
  control now applies RocketSim's own real `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` values
  directly (`AIR_CONTROL_PITCH_TORQUE`/`AIR_CONTROL_YAW_TORQUE`/
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_TORQUE` = 130/95/400) through it, scaled by a
  newly-fetched real constant (`CAR_TORQUE_SCALE ≈ 0.095882`, RocketSim's
  own `RLConst.h`) — replacing the old placeholder-plus-ratio scheme
  through `apply_torque`. An independent check (real constants alone)
  predicts `≈9.109` rad/s² for full yaw input, matching the recorded car's
  own measured `≈9.12` rad/s² even more tightly. On the isolated fixture,
  the specific pre-dodge orientation gap this investigation targeted
  shrank `~40%` (`~12.5°`→`~7.4°`), though the fixture's own
  whole-trajectory divergence stayed essentially flat — expected, since a
  residual gap still gets amplified by the dodge's own orientation-
  relative impulse and `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s separate, still-unfixed
  post-dodge spin-rate mismatch continues to dominate that aggregate
  metric. All pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged. That
  residual `~7°` gap has since been traced further: isolating per-tick
  angular velocity during the fixture's own second pre-dodge sub-phase
  found the candidate's change to be almost exactly the *negative* of the
  recorded car's own, at only `1.54°` orientation distance — far too
  small a gap to explain via accumulated drift. RocketSim's real
  `Car.cpp`/`Car.h` confirm why: `_UpdateAirTorque` applies pitch and roll
  about `dirPitch_right = -GetRightDir()`/`dirRoll_forward =
  -GetForwardDir()` (the *negative* of the car's own axes; only yaw's
  `dirYaw_up` is unnegated), while this port applies both about the
  *positive* axes. Now fixed, for air control and the dodge together —
  the dodge, checked against RocketSim's `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` in the
  same pass, had the same bug three ways (pitch translation, pitch spin,
  and roll spin all inverted; only the roll translation matched):
  `drive.rs` applies air control's pitch about `-right_axis` and roll
  about `-forward`, and both dodge blocks form `dodge_forward =
  -norm_pitch` (RocketSim's own `dodgeDir.x`) for impulse, spin, and the
  renamed `dodge_is_backward` classification, with the roll spin about
  `-forward`. 14 tests switched to real Rocket League's own stick
  convention (`pitch = -1` is a forward flip / nose-down); the
  `rb_verify_cli` baseline test became a ratchet
  (`cars.mean_position_distance < 1000` uu). Real-data effect on the
  isolated fixture: the pre-dodge orientation gap is closed (`~0.22` →
  `~0.13` → `~0.03` rad across the three fixes) and the whole-fixture car
  position divergence dropped `≈2792` → `≈937` uu (`-66%`). What remains
  is post-dodge — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s continuous flip torque is now
  the dominant remaining gap, and is scoped for implementation as
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-080` (doc-only): the real flip torque is applied
  inertia-independently but without `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE`, so it drives the
  car to `CAR_MAX_ANG_SPEED` within three ticks and holds it there for
  `0.65` s with stick air control off, bleeds vertical speed `×0.65`/tick
  from `0.15` s, locks pitch `0.3` s after, and cancels via `FR-070`'s
  pitch-hold scale — each piece confirmed to the tick by the isolated
  fixture (`|ω|` pinned at exactly `5.50` through `t ≈ 4.967`, `vel.z` at
  the `-15.5` uu/s damping equilibrium). The same data confirms the real
  initial dodge velocity is `500` (`FLIP_INITIAL_VEL_SCALE`), so
  `DODGE_SPEED = 1400` is `2.8x` too large. `FR-080` step (a) is now
  done: `drive::DODGE_SPEED` is the real `500.0`, and the backward dodge's
  forward-axis component carries the real `FLIP_BACKWARD_IMPULSE_SCALE_X =
  16/15` (`DODGE_BACKWARD_SCALE_X`). Measured alone on the isolated
  fixture: `cars.mean_position_distance` `≈937` → `≈573` uu (`-39%`), and
  the dodge-tick window's velocity gap `≈1032` → `≈126` uu/s — that jump
  was almost entirely the placeholder. One new test; the `rb_verify_cli`
  ratchet tightened to `< 600` uu. `FR-080` step (b) is now done too: a
  per-car `drive::DodgeFlip { rel_torque, elapsed }` replaces the
  `dodge_flip_active` flag and the instantaneous `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`
  kick (removed) with the real mechanism — `FLIP_TORQUE_X = 260`/
  `FLIP_TORQUE_Y = 224` applied inertia-cancelled and per-tick without
  `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE` for `FLIP_TORQUE_TIME = 0.65` s (so the existing
  angular-speed cap holds the car at `5.5` rad/s from the third tick),
  stick air control and the landing assist locked out meanwhile, pitch
  locked `FLIP_PITCHLOCK_EXTRA_TIME = 0.3` s longer, `FLIP_Z_DAMP_120 =
  0.35` bleeding vertical speed per tick from `0.15` s, landing clearing
  the state. `FR-016`'s jump-press cancel stays as the interim, now ending
  the real flip too. Measured alone: `cars.mean_position_distance` `≈573`
  → `≈259` uu (`-55%`), max `≈2005` → `≈528` uu; the remaining rotation
  gap grows inside the flip window at a pinned `|ω|`, an axis mismatch
  pointing at the real flip cancel, step (c). 12 tests rewritten, 9 new;
  ratchet `< 300` uu. Step (c) is now done too: the real pitch-hold flip
  cancel (`1 - |pitch|` on the flip's pitch component when the signs
  match) replaces `FR-016`'s jump-press cancel, which is removed. It
  changed nothing inside the flip window, so the gap there was run to
  ground at the tick, against both RocketSim and RLUtilities: yaw/roll
  air control and the `FR-071` damping stay live mid-flip with only pitch
  locked (77 ticks fit to `0.0025` rad/s rms; the references' lockout
  `0.102`), and the angular-speed clamp belongs after the transform
  integration (the recording turns `7.58` rad/s per tick at a reported
  `5.50`; RocketSim's `_FinishPhysicsTick` runs after `stepSimulation`).
  Both adopted: the flip window now matches to within `0.1` rad,
  `cars.mean_position_distance` `≈259` → `≈237` uu, and the un-damped
  post-window spin is the unmasked next gap (`FR-071`). 8 tests rewritten,
  5 new; ratchet `< 250` uu. `FR-071` is now implemented too: real Rocket
  League's per-axis air-control damping (`AIR_CONTROL_PITCH/YAW/ROLL_DAMPING
  = 30/20/50`, `drive::air_control_damping`) bleeds each body-axis spin
  component every airborne step, the pitch and yaw terms scaled by `1 -
  |stick|`, mid-flip and under the pitch lock included; the placeholder
  landing auto-orientation assist (`FR-018`'s `LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`)
  is removed, since real Rocket League has none (`FR-060`) and the fixture
  measured a wash with it. The fixture's rotation gap now stays under
  `0.1` rad through its entire airborne phase (whole-run mean rotation
  `1.51` → `0.77` rad); the divergence that remains starts at the landing.
  See `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`'s, `FR-080`'s and `FR-071`'s own entries for
  the full evidence chain. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-081` (documentation only)
  then diagnosed what remains: the through-flight velocity gap is born in
  the four post-jump ticks where the real car's suspension keeps its
  wheels in contact; the dodge impulse uses tilted 3D axes where RocketSim
  flattens them; the recorded car hits the ball and the port's never does;
  the landing is a suspension there and a bouncing box here; and the real
  hitbox is offset `(13.9, 0, 20.8)` uu from the recorded position.
  Finding 2 is now implemented: the dodge's translation impulse runs along
  the flattened, horizontal forward/right (`drive::dodge_axes_2d`) in both
  dodge paths — dodge-tick velocity window `121 → 88` uu/s, whole-run mean
  velocity `≈337 → ≈303` uu/s, mean rotation `0.77 → 0.68` rad, position
  unchanged as diagnosed. Finding 5 is implemented for body-vs-body
  contact (`body::CAR_HITBOX_OFFSET`, `RigidBody::hitbox_offset`/
  `hitbox_center`, `collision::contacts_between` meeting each shape at its
  mount) — not against static surfaces, since the real car rests on its
  wheels with the hitbox `18.4` uu clear of the ground and a wheel-less
  offset box would drop a seeded car `18` uu; the unoffset box stands in
  for the wheel support until the suspension model, which is next as its
  own entry. That entry now exists: `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-082` scopes the
  wheel/suspension/tire model complete from RocketSim's `btVehicleRL`
  and `_UpdateWheels` (raycast wheels, spring-damper suspension, tire
  friction curves, analog handbrake, throttle/brake/coast, steer-angle
  curves, sticky force, car-up jump, auto-roll), shows its constants
  reproduce the recorded rest height and post-jump contact, and fixes
  the design and a three-step sequencing before any code. Step (a) is
  implemented: the `wheels` module (four raycast wheels at the Octane
  mounts on the real spring-damper suspension with the sticky force
  and the `extraPushback` hard stop; tire friction impulses — Bullet's
  bilateral lateral grip and the engine/brake/coast rolling term — with
  RocketSim's one-tick lag; the real steer-angle curve on the front
  wheels; the real handbrake lateral factor; `on_ground` from the
  wheel count; the jump along the car's up), `collision::ray_vs_plane`,
  `PhysicsWorld::car_wheels`, and the chassis meeting the arena at its
  real mount. `STEER_TORQUE`, `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`, and
  `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION` are gone. The isolated fixture went `239.55 →
  160.19` uu and the port's car hits the ball for the first time
  (`mean_ball_distance` `729.95 → 79.55` uu). `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
  gains a RocketSim (MIT) section. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-083` then
  diagnoses what the wheels left: the port's car hits the ball three
  ticks late and mid-jump because it lacks RocketSim's
  `THROTTLE_AIR_ACCEL` (`66.7` uu/s² forward while airborne with
  throttle), and six more findings ranked by cost — the jump hold's
  `0.62` pre-minimum scale contradicted by the capture, the flip torque
  on the press tick, primed drive fields at the seed, the car-ball
  hit's per-pair material and extra impulse, a missing pitch input in
  the fixture at its second dodge, and RL's wheels outlasting
  RocketSim's ray by a tick or two after a jump.
- `rb_domain::divergence::score` now also scores car position/rotation/
  velocity divergence (`RB-VERIFY-003-FR-002`), matching cars between
  sequences by `player_id`. New `Quat::angle_to` computes rotation
  distance.
- `rb_domain::divergence::score` now aligns frames by nearest timestamp
  instead of list index (`RB-VERIFY-003-FR-003`), within a new required
  `max_timestamp_delta_secs` parameter. `rb_verify_cli` gains
  `DEFAULT_MAX_TIMESTAMP_DELTA_SECS` and an optional third CLI argument
  to override it. `RB-VERIFY-003` now has all three functional
  requirements implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet`: box-shaped car bodies (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-004`) —
  a unified `RigidBody`/`Shape` design, a general 3x3 inverse inertia
  tensor (`Mat3`), analytic box-vs-plane contact generation (1-4 points),
  and multi-contact manifold resolution in the solver. `PhysicsWorld`
  gains an optional car body (`with_car`). Box-vs-sphere collision and
  driven car input remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet`: ball-vs-car collision, completing
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-004` — analytic sphere-vs-box contact generation
  (`collision::sphere_vs_box`/`contact_between`, handling both the
  ordinary and deep-penetration cases) and a two-dynamic-body
  sequential-impulse solver path (`solver::resolve_contact_between`).
  `rb_domain::Quat` gains `conjugate`. Box-vs-box collision and driven car
  input remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet`: car-vs-car collision *detection*
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-006`) — `collision::box_vs_box`, a 15-axis
  separating-axis test between two oriented boxes, producing a clipped
  face manifold (0-4 points) or a single edge-edge point. Not wired into
  `PhysicsWorld`: this scope has exactly one car, so the collision has no
  live caller yet — multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support remains not
  implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet`: multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support, completing
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-006` — `PhysicsWorld::step` now resolves every car's
  ground contact, every ball-vs-car pair, and every car-vs-car pair
  (running `box_vs_box` for real in a live scene for the first time), one
  pair at a time. A combined multi-body solve across 3+ simultaneously
  touching bodies and driven car input remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-007`) — couples
  `rb_domain::ControllerInput` into ground-driving throttle force and
  steering torque on a car, gated on ground contact. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `set_car_input` (a car's current, persistent input) and `frame()` now
  reports it. Boost, jump, air control, and handbrake remain not
  implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-008`) — boost: a flat
  forward force (not speed-tapered like throttle), not gated on ground
  contact (works identically airborne). `PhysicsWorld` gains a depletable
  `car_boost: Vec<f32>` resource and `set_car_boost`; holding boost drains
  it over time, even once the force stops applying at `MAX_CAR_SPEED`;
  `frame()` now reports each car's actual `boost_amount`. Jump, air
  control, and handbrake remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-009`) — handbrake: while
  held and grounded, temporarily reduces the car's `RigidBody.friction`
  (restored on release), letting existing momentum carry it into a slide.
  `PhysicsWorld` gains `car_base_friction: Vec<f32>`, snapshotted per car
  by `with_car`, so release restores each car's own base friction. Jump
  and air control remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-010`) — a single ground
  jump: a fixed instantaneous upward velocity change fired on the rising
  edge of `ControllerInput.jump` while grounded, gated so holding or a
  release-then-re-press mid-air doesn't re-fire it. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `car_jump_held: Vec<bool>` to track the rising-edge state per car.
  Double jump/dodge, variable jump height, wall jump, and air control
  remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-011`) — air control:
  torque about the car's local right/up/forward axes from
  `ControllerInput.pitch`/`yaw`/`roll`, gated on the car *not* touching
  the ground, not speed-scaled (unlike ground steering). Double
  jump/dodge, variable jump height, and wall jump remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-012`) — double jump: one
  more, identical `JUMP_SPEED` impulse fired on a fresh airborne press of
  `ControllerInput.jump`, reusing the ground jump's own rising-edge
  detection and the `JUMP_SPEED` constant (now `pub`) itself. Gated on a
  new per-car `double_jump_available` flag rather than ground contact —
  restored on landing, consumed by use. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `car_double_jump_available: Vec<bool>`. The dodge directional
  impulse/torque, variable jump height, and wall jump remain not
  implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-013`) — arena walls and wall
  jump: `PhysicsWorld` gains `walls: Vec<StaticPlane>`/`with_wall`, and
  every body now collides with every wall via the same
  body-vs-static-plane machinery the ground already uses
  (`resolve_ground_contact` renamed `resolve_plane_contact`).
  `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a wall jump — an
  outward-plus-upward impulse fired on a fresh airborne jump press while
  touching a wall, taking priority over the double jump on that press but
  restoring (not consuming) `double_jump_available` on mere contact. The
  dodge directional impulse/torque, variable jump height, and a modeled
  arena footprint beyond generic flat walls remain not implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-014`) — dodge: the double
  jump's fresh press now checks `ControllerInput.pitch`/`roll`, firing a
  directional dodge (a horizontal `DODGE_SPEED` impulse plus an
  instantaneous `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` spin) instead of the plain vertical
  double jump whenever either exceeds a new `DODGE_DEADZONE`, reusing air
  control's own pitch/roll axis and sign conventions. Shares the double
  jump's `double_jump_available` resource; wall jump never dodges,
  regardless of stick input. `DODGE_SPEED` and `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED`
  are now `pub`. A dodge variant of the wall jump, flip-cancel, landing
  auto-orientation assistance, and variable jump height remain not
  implemented.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-015`) — variable jump
  height: the ground jump gains a hold window — continuing to hold
  `ControllerInput.jump` after the fresh press that fires it adds a
  continuous `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION` upward force, for up to
  `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION` seconds, on top of the fixed `JUMP_SPEED`
  impulse; releasing `jump` (or the window running out) stops the extra
  acceleration immediately. A new `jump_hold_time_remaining` is checked
  and decremented before the ground jump's own fresh-press handling can
  re-arm it, so a fresh press's own step is unaffected. Scoped to the
  ground jump alone — the double jump, a dodge, and the wall jump remain
  fixed-impulse. `PhysicsWorld` gains `car_jump_hold_time_remaining:
  Vec<f32>`.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`) — flip-cancel: a
  dodge's spin can now be canceled early — a further fresh
  `ControllerInput.jump` press while airborne, not touching a wall, with
  the double jump already spent, zeroes `RigidBody.angular_velocity`
  outright. A new `dodge_flip_active` flag tracks this: the dodge branch
  sets it, the plain-double-jump branch explicitly clears it (preventing a
  stale flag from an earlier dodge from leaking into a later unrelated
  double jump). Doesn't touch linear velocity or `double_jump_available`;
  wall jump keeps priority, unchanged. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `car_dodge_flip_active: Vec<bool>`.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-017`) — wall-jump dodge:
  the wall jump's own fresh press now checks
  `ControllerInput.pitch`/`roll` against `DODGE_DEADZONE`, same as the
  ground double jump; at or above it, a wall-jump dodge fires (the wall
  push-off combined with a `DODGE_SPEED` component and
  `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` spin, arming `dodge_flip_active`); below it, the
  plain wall jump fires unchanged. Unlike the plain wall jump, the dodge
  variant consumes `double_jump_available` — a documented simplification,
  since gating it on that flag would be vacuous (wall touch always
  restores it first). No new physics constants. Two pre-existing tests
  asserting the old "wall jump always ignores stick input" premise were
  repurposed to assert the new behavior.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-018`) — landing
  auto-orientation assist: a gentle continuous restoring torque, applied
  while airborne, nudging the car's local up axis back toward world up
  (`up_axis(car).cross(&world_up) * LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`, whose
  magnitude is already proportional to the tilt angle's sine). Gated on no
  active `pitch`/`roll` this step and no fresh `jump` press this step
  (avoiding a same-step conflict with a dodge's/wall-jump-dodge's/
  double-jump's/flip-cancel's own direct angular-velocity change). Applies
  continuously whenever airborne rather than only near the ground — this
  port has no raycast/distance query to replicate real Rocket League's
  actual ground-proximity trigger. New constant
  `LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE` is an uncalibrated placeholder, one order
  of magnitude smaller than `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`. No new `PhysicsWorld`
  state.
- `rb_physics_bullet::arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-019`) — modeled arena
  footprint: a new module builds Rocket League's real standard-arena
  boundary from FR-013's existing `StaticPlane`/`with_wall` machinery (no
  new collision code). `standard_ground` is the flat floor at `z = 0`;
  `standard_walls` returns 9 planes — 2 side walls, 2 back walls, a
  ceiling, and 4 diagonal corner walls cutting off the true rectangular
  corner, giving the field its real octagonal footprint. `SIDE_WALL_X`
  (4096), `BACK_WALL_Y` (5120), and `CEILING_Z` (2044) are commonly-cited
  field dimensions; the corner inset (`CORNER_LENGTH`) is this project's
  own uncalibrated placeholder with no real-mesh reference. New
  `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` convenience constructor wires both into a
  scene in one call, alongside the existing `PhysicsWorld::new`/`with_wall`
  ad-hoc-wall capability. Curved wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling transitions,
  goal cutouts, and corner-touch disambiguation for wall-jump purposes
  remain not modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`collision`/`world`/`arena`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-020`) — curved wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling
  transitions: a new `StaticQuarterPipe` shape (an immovable
  partial-cylinder fillet, infinite along its own axis) and
  `contacts_vs_quarter_pipe` (sphere-only; a box always returns no
  contact). The playable side is the *inside* of the fillet's concave face
  (like a skateboard quarter-pipe): governed only within a 90-degree
  sector, contact fires as the sphere's surface crosses the fillet's own
  radius from inside, pushing back toward the axis (the opposite direction
  from a flat plane's push). `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` derives a
  fillet's geometry automatically from two perpendicular, axis-aligned
  flat planes. `PhysicsWorld` gains `curves`/`with_curve`/
  `resolve_curve_contact`; `solver::resolve_contacts`'s second parameter
  changed from `&StaticPlane` to plain `restitution`/`friction` (the only
  two fields it ever used) so the same solver path serves a fillet too.
  `arena::standard_curves` builds the 8 cardinal-wall fillets (new
  uncalibrated placeholder `FILLET_RADIUS`); `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena`
  now adds these alongside its 9 walls. A car (box) actually being
  deflected by a fillet, fillets at the 4 diagonal corner walls, and goal
  cutouts remain not modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-021`) — curved
  corner-wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling transitions, extending FR-020 to the
  4 diagonal corner walls: `arena::standard_curves` now returns 16
  `StaticQuarterPipe`s (one floor-side and one ceiling-side per wall, all 9
  walls) instead of 8. `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` needed no code
  changes — its real correctness requirement was never "axis-aligned
  planes," only that the two bridged planes' normals are mutually
  perpendicular, which holds for a corner wall meeting the floor/ceiling
  regardless of the corner wall's own horizontal rotation. A corner wall's
  fillet `axis_direction` is computed via a cross product
  (`floor.normal.cross(&wall.normal)`, already unit length by construction)
  rather than hand-picked, since it isn't a coordinate axis the way a
  cardinal wall's is. A car actually being deflected by any fillet, a
  fillet at a corner wall's own vertical edges (now implemented, see
  FR-022), and goal cutouts remain not modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`collision`/`arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-022`) —
  curved corner-wall vertical-edge fillets: rounds off the 8 remaining
  sharp edges in the standard arena's octagonal footprint, where each of
  the 4 diagonal corner walls meets its neighboring side or back wall.
  `arena::standard_curves` now returns 24 `StaticQuarterPipe`s (the 16
  floor/ceiling-seam fillets already built, plus 8 vertical-edge fillets).
  Unlike every prior fillet, the two planes a vertical-edge fillet bridges
  aren't perpendicular (a corner wall meets its neighbor at 135 degrees,
  not 90) — `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` is now fully general to
  handle this: it solves the axis point as a real 2x2 linear system rather
  than assuming orthogonal normals, its own sector angle comes out to
  exactly the angle between the two planes' normals (45 degrees here, 90
  for a floor/ceiling seam), and it self-corrects a "backwards"
  `axis_direction` internally so a caller can pass either of the two
  opposite directions along the shared edge line. `sphere_vs_quarter_pipe`'s
  sector-membership test is likewise generalized from a two-dot-products
  shortcut (only correct for a 90-degree sector) to a signed-cross-product
  test valid for any sector up to 180 degrees. `FILLET_RADIUS` is reused
  as-is once again. A car actually being deflected by any fillet, the
  compound corner where a vertical-edge fillet meets a floor/ceiling-seam
  fillet (now implemented, see FR-023), and goal cutouts remain not
  modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`collision`/`arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-023`) —
  compound-corner fillets: rounds off the last 16 sharp vertices in the
  standard arena's vertical boundary, where a corner wall's own
  vertical-edge fillet (FR-022) meets a floor- or ceiling-seam fillet
  (FR-020/FR-021). Introduces a new static shape, `body::StaticCornerFillet`
  (an immovable sphere blending three flat planes at a vertex, since no
  cylindrical `StaticQuarterPipe` can blend three planes at once), with
  constructor `between_three_planes` solving the center as the common
  intersection of the three planes' pairwise `StaticQuarterPipe::
  between_planes` axis lines via the cross-product form of Cramer's rule.
  New `collision::sphere_vs_corner_fillet` generalizes a
  `StaticQuarterPipe`'s 2-sided sector test to a 3-bound "spherical
  triangle" containment test, each bound a sign-corrected, non-normalized
  cross product of a pair of the three normals. New `arena::
  standard_corner_fillets` builds all 16 (4 per corner wall, times the 4
  corner walls) directly from the same three flat planes `standard_walls`
  already builds, reusing `FILLET_RADIUS` once again. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `corner_fillets`/`with_corner_fillet`, resolved for the ball and every
  car exactly like `curves`. A car actually being deflected by any fillet
  and goal cutouts (now implemented, see FR-024) remain not modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`collision`/`arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-024`) —
  goal cutouts: opens an actual goal-mouth window in each back wall, where
  every prior increment had a single solid, flat plane spanning the full
  width. Introduces a new static shape, `body::StaticGoalWall` (a
  `StaticPlane` plus a rectangular window in the plane's own local
  `u_axis`/`v_axis` frame), with `contains_in_window` testing a point's
  projection onto that frame directly. New
  `collision::sphere_vs_goal_wall`/`contacts_vs_goal_wall`: a sphere (the
  ball) gets no contact inside the window, letting it pass through; a box
  (car) falls straight through to the ordinary `contacts_vs_plane` against
  the wrapped plane, deliberately ignoring the window — a zero-regression
  choice for a car. `arena::standard_walls` drops its 2 back-wall
  `StaticPlane`s (now 7 planes instead of 9); new `arena::
  standard_goal_walls` returns them instead as 2 `StaticGoalWall`s,
  windowed at new constants `GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`/`GOAL_HEIGHT`. New `arena::
  standard_goal_cutout_fillets` rounds each window's 3 edges (two posts
  and a crossbar per goal, 6 `StaticQuarterPipe`s total, added to the same
  `curves` list), built via `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` from the
  real back-wall plane and a purely-geometric post/crossbar plane never
  itself added as a real collision wall. `PhysicsWorld` gains
  `goal_walls`/`with_goal_wall`, resolved for the ball *and* every car
  (unlike `curves`/`corner_fillets`). A car actually being deflected by
  any fillet or driving into a goal, and a modeled goal interior/net
  beyond the cutout, remain not modeled.
- `rb_physics_bullet::arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-025`) — corner-wall
  floor/ceiling arch radius: a diagonal corner wall's own floor-seam and
  ceiling-seam fillets now use a new, distinctly larger
  `arena::CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` (750 uu) instead of the cardinal walls' own
  `FILLET_RADIUS` (292 uu), matching real Rocket League's bigger, more
  swept corner-boost curve. All 16 `standard_corner_fillets` switch to
  `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` too, since `StaticCornerFillet::between_three_planes`
  needs one shared radius across all three planes it blends to still meet
  its adjoining edge fillets exactly where their axes cross. The 8
  cardinal-wall floor/ceiling seams, 8 vertical corner-edge fillets
  (FR-022), and 6 goal-cutout edge fillets (FR-024) are unaffected and
  keep `FILLET_RADIUS`. A compile-time assertion enforces
  `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS > FILLET_RADIUS`.
- `rb_physics_bullet::arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-026`) — goal
  post-crossbar corner fillets: new `arena::standard_goal_corner_fillets`
  rounds off the two compound corners per goal where a post's own
  vertical edge fillet meets the crossbar's own horizontal edge fillet (4
  total), via `StaticCornerFillet::between_three_planes` on the real back
  wall/post/crossbar planes — the same approach FR-023 used for the
  arena's own compound corners, reusing `FILLET_RADIUS` unchanged since
  both edge fillets meeting here already share one radius. The goal's
  other two corners, where a post meets the floor, get no such treatment
  (the window's bottom edge sits exactly at floor level already).
  `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` wires the 4 new fillets in, bringing
  `corner_fillets` to 20 total.
- `rb_physics_bullet::collision` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027`) — car deflection
  by curved fillets: new `collision::box_vs_quarter_pipe`/
  `box_vs_corner_fillet` test a box's own 8 corners against the curved
  surface as zero-radius spheres, the same "test every corner" technique
  `box_vs_plane` already used for a flat plane; `contacts_vs_quarter_pipe`/
  `contacts_vs_corner_fillet` now dispatch a `Shape::Box` to these instead
  of `Vec::new()`. Closes the Non-goal repeated since FR-020: a car is now
  actually deflected by every curved fillet in this port, not just the
  ball. No `PhysicsWorld::step` changes needed — the car-side resolve
  calls already existed, just as silent no-ops. Documented as an
  approximation (a flush box face against a shallow curve can under-detect
  contact), not a full convex-vs-curved-surface narrow phase.
  `StaticGoalWall`/`contacts_vs_goal_wall` is unaffected — a goal wall
  isn't a curved fillet, so a car still can't drive into a goal.
- `rb_physics_bullet::collision` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-028`) — a car can
  actually drive into a goal now: new `collision::box_vs_goal_wall` tests
  each of a box's 8 corners against `StaticGoalWall`'s window (a corner
  inside the window contributes no contact, mirroring
  `sphere_vs_goal_wall`'s pass-through rule per corner instead of once for
  the ball's single center point); `contacts_vs_goal_wall` now dispatches
  a `Shape::Box` to it instead of falling straight through to an
  unwindowed `contacts_vs_plane`. A car only partly lined up with the
  window gets a real partial block — the corners still outside it still
  register a contact. No `PhysicsWorld::step` changes needed, same as
  FR-027 — `resolve_goal_wall_contact` already ran for every car. Goal
  interior/net still not modeled — the goal opens onto open space for a
  car too, not a bounded volume.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`collision`/`arena` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`) —
  a modeled goal interior: new `body::StaticBoundedWall` collides only
  *within* a rectangular bound (the opposite gate from `StaticGoalWall`'s
  window), with new `collision::sphere_vs_bounded_wall`/
  `box_vs_bounded_wall`/`contacts_vs_bounded_wall`. New
  `arena::standard_goal_back_walls` (2 plain, unbounded planes `GOAL_DEPTH`
  behind each real back wall — reachable only through the window, so
  unbounded is exact here), `standard_goal_side_walls` (4 bounded walls,
  reusing `goal_post_plane` unchanged) and `standard_goal_roofs` (2 bounded
  walls, reusing `goal_crossbar_plane` unchanged) close the "ball/car
  passes into open space" gap FR-024 through FR-028 all flagged. New
  `PhysicsWorld.bounded_walls`/`with_bounded_wall`, resolved for the ball
  and every car. Models a solid bounding volume, not a net mesh — no
  cloth/soft-body simulation added.
- `rb_physics_bullet::solver`/`world` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`) — a
  combined multi-body solve: new `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds`
  resolves every ball-vs-car and car-vs-car contact manifold in a step
  together, sharing one `DeltaVelocity` accumulator per body index across
  every manifold that body takes part in (via new helper `delta_pair_mut`),
  instead of `PhysicsWorld::step` calling `resolve_contacts_between` once
  per pair and fully applying each pair's own result before the next
  pair's setup even read a body's velocity. Fixes the "3+ bodies mutually
  touching in the same step" approximation (e.g. a car pinned between the
  ball and another car) tracked since multi-car support was added. Static
  contacts (ground/walls/curves/goal geometry) are unaffected — each
  body's contact with static geometry never depended on another dynamic
  body, so only the dynamic-vs-dynamic path needed the fix.
- `rb_physics_bullet::drive` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`) — a scoped
  constant-calibration audit (does NOT close `FR-005`'s real-data
  calibration, still blocked on `PHASE-0-EXIT`): sourced every
  uncalibrated placeholder constant against RocketSim, RLUtilities, and
  the RLBot community wiki. Corrected `JUMP_SPEED` (→ `875.0/3.0`) and
  `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION` (→ `4375.0/3.0`) to their precise real values;
  added `UNBOOSTED_MAX_CAR_SPEED` (1410) as throttle's own speed cap,
  separate from the boosted `MAX_CAR_SPEED` (2300) — a real fix, since
  throttle alone previously could reach the boosted top speed. Confirmed
  several more constants already correct (`JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`,
  `BOOST_ACCELERATION`, `MAX_BOOST`, gravity, `GOAL_DEPTH`) and explicitly
  flagged the rest as audited-but-still-uncalibrated in their own doc
  comments, rather than silently leaving them ambiguous.
- `rb_physics_bullet::collision` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-032`) — investigated a
  claimed corner-testing under-detection bug for `box_vs_quarter_pipe`/
  `box_vs_corner_fillet` (a box face resting flush against a shallow curve
  could have every corner clear while the face's middle already
  overlapped it) by building a genuine GJK closest-points replacement.
  Wiring it in broke two real end-to-end tests, because closest-point
  answers the wrong question for this contact — it's a containment
  question (is the box's farthest point from the axis/center at or beyond
  radius), and distance-from-a-line/point's maximum over a convex
  polytope is always at a corner, so the original per-corner technique is
  exact for this question, not an approximation. Reverted to the original
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027` implementation and deleted the GJK module
  entirely; corrected every doc comment across the crate and its spec
  that had inherited the unverified claim. No production-code change to
  the narrow phase itself.
- `rb_physics_bullet::net` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-033`) — a genuine
  mass-spring net panel per goal, catching the ball. New `net::NetMesh`: a
  rectangular grid of point masses (`RigidBody::sphere`, tiny and light)
  with every perimeter point anchored to the rigid goal frame and every
  interior point free, connected by structural/shear springs (Hooke's law
  plus damping). Ball contact against a free point goes through a new
  `collision::sphere_vs_sphere` (this crate's first real sphere-vs-sphere
  test) plus the existing `solver::resolve_contacts_between` path — no new
  solver code. New `arena::standard_nets` builds one panel per goal,
  `NET_DEPTH` behind the real back wall and well in front of
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`'s own rigid back-of-net plane (unchanged, still
  a car's real backstop, since a car isn't tested against the net at all).
  `PhysicsWorld` gains `nets`/`with_net`. Every new constant is an
  uncalibrated placeholder.
- `rb_physics_bullet::solver` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-034`) — split impulse.
  Every contact's normal row now also solves a second, entirely separate
  "push" pseudo-velocity channel (`resolve_push_row`/
  `resolve_two_body_push_row`), fed only by that contact's own positional
  (penetration/ERP) error, never its velocity/restitution error.
  `ConstraintRow`/`TwoBodyRow` gained `rhs_penetration`/
  `applied_push_impulse` fields, splitting the old combined `rhs` term.
  After each manifold's iterations, the real velocity delta is applied to
  the body exactly as before, and the new push delta is applied directly
  to the body's position/orientation via a new `apply_push_delta` (built
  on the existing `integrate::integrate_transform`) — mirroring Bullet's
  own `btSolverBody::writebackVelocity`. Wired into `resolve_contacts`,
  `resolve_contacts_between`, and `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` with zero
  call-site changes anywhere outside `solver.rs`.
- `rb_physics_bullet::solver` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-035`) — warm-starting,
  scoped to `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` only. A new `solver::ContactCache`
  carries a manifold's converged real-channel impulses from one call to
  the next, matched by each contact's approximate world position. A new
  `warm_start_two_body_row` applies each row's cached impulse directly to
  the manifold's shared `DeltaVelocity` accumulators before iterating
  (merely setting `applied_impulse` would do nothing on its own, since
  `GLOBAL_CFM` is always `0.0`). `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` gained a new
  `caches: &mut HashMap<(usize, usize), ContactCache>` parameter, rebuilt
  from only that call's manifolds each time. `PhysicsWorld` gains one
  persistent `dynamic_manifold_caches` field. Deliberately not wired into
  `resolve_contacts`/`resolve_contacts_between` — see that FR's own
  Non-goals.
- `rb_physics_bullet::arena`/`collision`/`net`/`solver`/`world`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-036`) — a dedicated follow-up to `FR-031`'s own
  audit, resolving the two ambiguities it surfaced but deliberately didn't
  act on, using real source-level research (RocketSim's and RLUtilities'
  own source, and the current RLBot wiki, read directly). Every `92.75`
  ball-radius literal became `93.15`, not the previously-suspected `91.25`
  — the real games split the ball into a smaller inertia radius (`91.25`)
  and a distinctly larger collision radius (`93.15`, the mesh's own
  collision margin), and since this port's single unified radius field has
  no separate collision margin of its own, the collision radius is the
  correct single-constant analog. `arena::CEILING_Z` changed from `2044.0`
  to `2048.0`, confirmed to share the same reference point as RocketSim's
  `ARENA_HEIGHT`. Also corrected two mis-documented claims:
  `arena::CORNER_LENGTH` and `arena::GOAL_DEPTH` were wrongly described as
  uncalibrated placeholders — both are confirmed exact, so only their doc
  comments changed. `arena::FILLET_RADIUS`/`CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` remain
  untouched and still genuinely uncalibrated. No new tests; all 259
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `rb_physics_bullet::body`/`drive`/`world` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-037`) —
  sleeping, closing the "no sleeping" half of `solver`'s own documented
  gap FR-035 left open. New `body::RigidBody` fields
  `is_sleeping: bool`/`sleep_timer: f32` and methods
  `update_sleep_state(&mut self, dt: f32)` (forcibly zeroes both
  velocities once they've stayed below new
  `LINEAR_SLEEP_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD`/`ANGULAR_SLEEP_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD`
  constants for `SLEEP_TIME_THRESHOLD` seconds, the actual fix for a
  bouncy resting contact never settling) and `wake(&mut self)` (the same
  reset, unconditionally). `PhysicsWorld::step` calls
  `update_sleep_state` for the ball and every car after every other
  contact resolves but before the transform integrates.
  `drive::apply_driven_forces` calls `car.wake()` unconditionally whenever
  a new `input_is_active` helper finds the car's input genuinely active,
  before that input's own force has had a chance to move it. 8 new tests
  (5 in `body.rs`, 3 in `world.rs`); all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `rb_physics_bullet::net`/`world` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-038`) — car-vs-net
  contact, closing this port's own former Non-goal that a car passes
  straight through a `net::NetMesh`'s spatial footprint untouched.
  `net::NetMesh::step` changed from a single `&mut RigidBody` (the ball
  alone) to `&mut [RigidBody]` (every body that can touch the net); its
  inner contact-resolution loop now iterates every body in the slice
  against each free point. No new collision code needed:
  `collision::contacts_between` already dispatches to `sphere_vs_box` for
  a car against a net point the same way it always has for ball-vs-car.
  `PhysicsWorld::step` reuses the same ball-plus-cars snapshot
  `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` already resolved that step for the
  net-step call too. All of `net.rs`'s pre-existing tests updated only
  their call syntax (`std::slice::from_mut(&mut ball)`), not their own
  assertions. 3 new tests (2 in `net.rs`, 1 in `world.rs`); all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `rb_physics_bullet::world` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-039`) — wall-jump corner
  disambiguation, closing the "first wall in `self.walls`" simplification
  documented since FR-013 and made reachable in the standard arena by
  FR-019's diagonal corner walls. `PhysicsWorld::step`'s per-car
  wall-normal computation now sums every wall a car is touching this step
  and normalizes the result, instead of picking whichever wall comes
  first — a car touching two walls at a corner now pushes off diagonally,
  blending both, instead of firing along only one of them. A car touching
  exactly one wall is unaffected. No new collision code needed. 1 new
  `world.rs` test; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `arena::FILLET_RADIUS`/`CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-040`) —
  a dedicated research pass, matching FR-036's own real-source-research
  method, looked for a real reference for both constants and found only
  one uncited RLBot wiki value ("wall bottom ramp radius: approx. 256, not
  circular") that doesn't distinguish the two constants, disclaims being
  circular, and shares its numeral with RLGym's unrelated `RAMP_HEIGHT`
  (a ramp's height, not a curve's radius) — deliberately not adopted. Both
  constants remain unchanged and genuinely uncalibrated; closing this for
  real needs actual extracted collision-mesh geometry. No new tests
  (documentation-only); all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-041`) —
  investigated whether anything short of real recorded data could narrow
  FR-030's own documented extreme-mass-ratio "sandwiched"
  under-convergence gap. A naive global over-relaxation factor was tried
  and rejected (provably diverges for that exact case); each manifold's
  velocity-row impulse now scales by a parameter-free `1 / k` instead
  (`k` = the number of manifolds sharing a body this step) — narrowing
  FR-030's own result from ~89.5 to ~32 units/s at zero added iteration
  cost, with zero effect on the overwhelming majority single-manifold
  case. 2 new tests; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `collision::box_vs_box` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-042`) — validated its
  edge-edge contact point and face-clipping degenerate fallback directly
  against Bullet's own `btBoxBoxDetector::dBoxBox` reference source.
  Confirmed this port's finite-segment edge-edge contact point is more
  rigorous than the reference's own unclamped-infinite-line one, and that
  this port's synthesize-rather-than-drop face-clipping fallback is a
  deliberate, favorable divergence from the reference's own drop-the-
  collision behavior. A candidate fix for the edge-edge tangent
  sign-selection heuristic was built and empirically tested but found
  genuinely mixed against a brute-force ground truth, so not adopted. No
  new tests (documentation-only); all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `solver::combine_restitution`/`combine_friction`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043`) — this project's own spec claimed Bullet's
  default combine mode is `max`, without ever having checked; fetched and
  read `btManifoldResult`'s real source and found that wrong (the real
  default for both is an unclamped product, `a * b`). This port's average
  combine mode is kept, now for a correct reason: it preserves the
  identity `combine(a, a) == a`, which the reference's real product does
  not, and most bodies here currently share the same uncalibrated
  placeholder coefficient. Corrected the wrong claim in the spec,
  `solver.rs`, and `body.rs`. 2 new tests pin the identity-preserving
  behavior directly; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `docs/specifications/physics/RB-PHYSICS-001-physics-core-port.md`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-044`) — this spec's own top-level Non-goals section
  still claimed split impulse wasn't implemented, contradicted by
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-034`'s own already-shipped implementation. Corrected
  the stale bullet to a strikethrough-and-close note, matching the
  convention this section already uses for two other resolved Non-goals
  items. Zero production code changed; no new tests.
- `integrate::integrate_transform` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-045`) — fetched and
  read Bullet's real `btRigidBody.cpp`/`.h`, `btTransformUtil.h`,
  `btQuaternion.h`, and `btScalar.h` and confirmed `apply_damping`,
  `integrate_velocities`, and `integrate_transform`'s reference claims all
  byte-for-byte accurate. Found this port's degenerate-quaternion epsilon
  (`1e-12`) numerically differs from Bullet's own `SIMD_EPSILON` (~5
  orders of magnitude larger) but is behaviorally equivalent, so not
  adopted. Found the check-then-normalize fallback branch matches Bullet's
  real choice to preserve the prior orientation rather than reset to
  identity on a degenerate result — a real distinction an unconditional
  `Quat::normalize` call would have gotten wrong. 1 new test pins this;
  all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `body::Shape::local_inertia`/`RigidBody::update_inertia_tensor`,
  `mat3::Mat3::scaled_columns`/`Mat3::from_quat`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-046`) — fetched and read Bullet's real
  `btSphereShape.cpp`, `btBoxShape.cpp`, `btRigidBody.cpp`/`.h`, and
  `btMatrix3x3.h` and confirmed the local-inertia formulas,
  `update_inertia_tensor`, and `scaled_columns` all byte-for-byte
  accurate. Found `Mat3::from_quat` hardcodes `s = 2` assuming a
  unit-length input, while the reference's own `setRotation`
  self-corrects for a non-unit-length one via `s = 2 / q.length2()` — not
  adopted, since this function's only production call site always
  receives an already-renormalized orientation. 1 new test pins this;
  all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `collision::sphere_vs_plane`/`box_vs_plane`/`sphere_vs_box`/
  `sphere_vs_sphere` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-047`) — fetched and read Bullet's
  real `btConvexPlaneCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`/`.h`,
  `btSphereBoxCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`,
  `btSphereSphereCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`, and `btManifoldPoint.h` and
  confirmed `sphere_vs_plane`/`sphere_vs_sphere` exact, and
  `sphere_vs_box`'s deep-penetration face selection confirmed to
  reproduce Bullet's own exact `+x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z` face-check
  tie-break order. Found `box_vs_plane` computes all 4 corners exactly in
  one pass, where real Bullet's default configuration produces only one
  contact point per frame via a single GJK support query, relying on
  several frames of persistent-manifold accumulation to reach the same
  4-corner manifold — a favorable divergence, not adopted, in the same
  spirit as `box_vs_box`'s own FR-042 finding. 1 new test pins the exact
  tie-break-order match; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `solver::restitution_curve`/`plane_space`/`setup_rows`/`resolve_row`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-048`) — fetched and read Bullet's real
  `btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver.cpp`/`.h`, `btContactSolverInfo.h`,
  and `btVector3.h` and confirmed `plane_space` byte-for-byte exact,
  `restitution_curve` behaviorally exact (its `.max(0.0)` folds in a
  clamp real Bullet applies at its own call site instead), `setup_rows`
  exact against real `setupContactConstraint`/`setupFrictionConstraint`
  (correcting a stale citation to an unrelated function), `resolve_row`'s
  unified two-bound resolver behaviorally equivalent to Bullet's own two
  separate resolvers, and all 6 of `btContactSolverInfo`'s cited defaults
  exact. Found one genuine, significant divergence, not adopted: this
  port always derives both friction directions from a fixed,
  velocity-independent basis, where real Bullet's actual default aligns
  one direction with the tangential component of the current relative
  sliding velocity — flagged as open follow-up work for a dedicated
  future FR rather than fixed here. 1 new test pins the
  `restitution_curve`/call-site-clamp equivalence; all pre-existing tests
  pass unchanged.
- `arena::GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`/`GOAL_HEIGHT` reference confirmation
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-055`) — fetched the current RLBot wiki's "Useful
  Game Values" page directly (the same page `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-036`'s own
  research used for `GOAL_DEPTH`) and confirmed both values exact against
  its own cited "Goal center-to-post"/"Goal height" numbers — no value
  change, a sourcing-status upgrade from "commonly-cited, unconfirmed" to
  "confirmed", the same non-behavioral outcome FR-036 reached for
  `GOAL_DEPTH`/`CORNER_LENGTH`. Also found and fixed a stale spec passage
  still describing `GOAL_DEPTH` as an unconfirmed "uncalibrated
  invention", contradicting FR-036's own already-shipped Requirements
  entry. No new tests; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `body::RigidBody::ball` (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-062`) — a new, additive
  constructor alongside the existing `sphere`/`car_box`, setting real
  Rocket League's own confirmed ball material properties instead of
  `sphere`'s generic `0.5`/`0.5`/`0.0` placeholders. Fetched RocketSim's
  own `RLConst.h` (matching FR-057/FR-060/FR-061's own method) and
  confirmed `BALL_RESTITUTION = 0.6f`, `BALL_FRICTION = 0.35f`, and
  `BALL_DRAG = 0.03f` — the same `BALL_DRAG` `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-061`'s own
  Non-goals had deferred for lack of a dedicated ball-construction API.
  `sphere` itself unchanged. `BALL_MASS_BT = CAR_MASS_BT / 6.f`
  deliberately not adopted, since this project has no canonical "real"
  car construction site yet to keep that ratio against. 3 new tests; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `solver::combine_restitution`/`combine_friction` real-Rocket-League
  reference finding (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-063`) — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043`
  had left open which formula matches real Rocket League itself. Fetched
  RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` (matching FR-057/FR-060/FR-061/FR-062's own
  method) and found the real answer isn't a different formula: real
  Rocket League hardcodes a distinct restitution/friction value per named
  contact-pair type (`CARWORLD_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION =
  0.3f`/`0.3f`, `CARCAR_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION = 0.09f`/`0.1f`,
  `CARBALL_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION = 2.0f`/`0.0f`), overriding
  whatever a generic per-body combine would produce — most strikingly, a
  car hitting the ball has zero restitution-driven bounce in real Rocket
  League, and car-vs-ball friction exceeds `1.0`, a value no per-body
  combine could produce. Corrected `combine_restitution`/
  `combine_friction`'s own doc comments and this spec's stale Open
  Questions bullet. Not adopted: real per-pair-type overrides, since
  those functions' own signature can't know which kind of pair produced
  their inputs — left for a future requirement. No new tests; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `drive::STEER_TORQUE` real-Rocket-League reference finding
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-065`) — `STEER_TORQUE` had no public reference at
  all. Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (`_UpdateWheels`, matching
  FR-058/FR-059/FR-064's own method) and found real Rocket League's
  steering isn't a direct yaw-torque model: a wheel's steer angle (from a
  confirmed `STEER_ANGLE_FROM_SPEED_CURVE`) feeds Bullet's own raycast
  vehicle system (`btVehicleRL`), whose per-wheel lateral tire friction
  is what actually turns the car — an architecture this port's
  single-rigid-box car has no way to represent, the same category
  FR-063 already established. The confirmed curve's own shape is also
  the opposite of this port's own `speed_factor`: real turning ability is
  highest at a standstill and decreases with speed, while this port's
  `speed_factor` is zero at a standstill and scales up with speed.
  Corrected `STEER_TORQUE`'s and `MAX_CAR_SPEED`'s own doc comments and
  the `speed_factor` call site's comment; also fixed adjacent stale text
  in the spec's own Open Questions section that still claimed
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`/`JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`/`JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION`
  had no public reference, contradicting FR-057's and FR-031's own
  already-shipped findings. Not adopted as a fix: the real curve maps
  speed to a wheel angle whose translation to yaw torque depends on
  tire-slip friction this port doesn't model, leaving no principled way
  to carry even the curve's shape onto this port's own direct-torque
  model. No new tests; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `drive::HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER` real-Rocket-League reference
  finding (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-066`) — `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER` had
  no public reference at all. Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`
  (`_UpdateWheels`, continuing FR-065's own investigation) and found real
  Rocket League's handbrake applies two separate confirmed real curves,
  `HANDBRAKE_LAT_FRICTION_FACTOR_CURVE` (a constant `0.1`) and
  `HANDBRAKE_LONG_FRICTION_FACTOR_CURVE` (`0.5` at a standstill, `0.9` at
  real driving speeds), to lateral and longitudinal tire friction
  independently — not one shared multiplier. This port's own pre-existing
  `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER = 0.1` happens to match the real
  lateral-only factor exactly, a striking coincidence, not a
  confirmation: applied to this port's single isotropic friction scalar,
  it also wrongly crushes longitudinal grip to a tenth, where real Rocket
  League keeps it near `0.9`, understating real forward-momentum
  retention during a drift. Corrected `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`'s
  own doc comment and the module doc's "Handbrake" and "commonly-cited
  constants" paragraphs; also fixed adjacent stale text in the spec's own
  Open Questions section. Not adopted as a fix: `solver::friction_directions`'
  own two tangent rows currently share one combined-friction scalar, and
  giving handbrake a genuinely different lateral-vs-longitudinal factor
  would mean threading a second friction coefficient through every one of
  `solver.rs`'s several row-limit call sites plus a way to know which
  body is handbraking — the same architecture-mismatch category
  FR-063/FR-065 already established. No new tests; all pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged.
- `drive::WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` real-Rocket-League reference finding
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-067`) — `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` had no public
  reference at all. Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (`_UpdateJump`) and
  found real Rocket League has no distinct wall-jump mechanic or constant
  at all: `_UpdateJump` applies exactly one impulse, `GetUpDir() *
  mutatorConfig.jumpImmediateForce` (the same real value this port's own
  `JUMP_SPEED` already matches), gated only on `isOnGround`, itself
  defined purely by wheel-contact count with no floor-vs-wall distinction;
  no `WALL_JUMP`-named constant exists anywhere in `RLConst.h`. Since
  FR-065 already confirmed real cars ride Bullet's own raycast vehicle
  system, a car driving on a wall has its own orientation continuously
  tipped by wheel/suspension contact forces to match that wall, so
  `GetUpDir()` already points along the wall's outward normal by the time
  a wall jump fires — real Rocket League's "wall jump" is the identical
  single grounded-jump impulse, not a distinct horizontal-plus-vertical
  composite. Corrected `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED`'s own doc comment, the
  module doc's wall-jump section, and the "commonly-cited constants"
  paragraph; also fixed adjacent stale text in the spec's own Open
  Questions section. Not adopted as a fix: this port's car has no wheels,
  raycasting, or surface-tracking orientation system at all (the same
  architecture gap FR-065 found for steering) — applying only `JUMP_SPEED`
  straight up on a wall touch would produce no push-off at all in this
  port's own model, so its own two-component composite substitute remains
  deliberate and necessary. No new tests; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- `drive::DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` real-Rocket-League mechanism finding
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`) — continuing the investigation FR-031's own
  audit first opened (which already found real reference constants,
  `FLIP_TORQUE_X=260`/`FLIP_TORQUE_Y=224`/`0.65`s, but not the mechanism
  behind them). Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` and found a flip's spin
  is a *continuous per-axis torque*, not an instantaneous angular-velocity
  kick: `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` records a per-axis `flipRelTorque` once,
  at flip start, and a separate, later step, `_UpdateAirTorque`, applies
  `flipRelTorque * Vec(FLIP_TORQUE_X, FLIP_TORQUE_Y, 0)` every physics tick
  for as long as `isFlipping = hasFlipped && flipTime < FLIP_TORQUE_TIME`
  holds, with no decay or ramp before that hard `0.65`s cutoff. Corrected
  `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`'s own doc comment, the module doc's dodge section,
  and the "commonly-cited constants" paragraph; also corrected the
  adjacent stale Open Questions bullet. Not adopted as a fix: real
  Rocket League's spin rate depends on its own specific hitbox inertia
  tensor, which this port's placeholder car body doesn't match (the same
  "false precision" reasoning FR-031 already applied), and reproducing the
  real timed-torque shape (rather than just its magnitude) would need new
  per-car elapsed-flip-time state threaded through `PhysicsWorld` — a
  redesign FR-059's own Non-goals already flagged as out of scope. No new
  tests; all 314 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- Real flip-cancel mechanism finding (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-070`) —
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s own fetch of `_UpdateAirTorque` surfaced a
  `pitchTorqueScale` factor scoped out as "an additional speed- or
  state-dependent scale... didn't fully characterize." Fetched RocketSim's
  own `Car.cpp` again and found real Rocket League's flip-cancel is driven
  by continuously *holding* pitch in the same direction as the flip's own
  pitch-torque component, scaling only that pitch-axis component by
  `1 - abs(controls.pitch)` every tick — not this port's own jump-press
  trigger that zeros every axis outright. A sideways (roll-only) dodge has
  no pitch-torque component, so real Rocket League can't pitch-cancel it at
  all. Corrected the `drive` module's flip-cancel doc comment, which had
  inaccurately claimed to match real Rocket League, and added a forward
  citation from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`'s own entry. Not adopted: this
  port's dodge has no per-axis torque split to partially cancel (the same
  architecture gap `FR-069` already found for the dodge's own spin), and
  reproducing the real continuous-hold trigger and pitch-only scope would
  need the same per-axis torque and elapsed-flip-time state `FR-059`'s own
  Non-goals already flagged as out of scope. No new tests; all 314
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- Real air-control damping mechanism finding (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-071`) —
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-068`'s own Non-goals had already found RocketSim's
  `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING = Vec(30, 20, 50)` exists but left it as "a
  separate, independent addition left for a future requirement" without
  examining the mechanism. Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` again (the
  same fetch `FR-070` used for `pitchTorqueScale`) and found the full
  mechanism: for each axis, real air control subtracts a damping torque
  `(angular velocity along that axis) * CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING[axis] *
  (1 - abs(analog input on that axis))` from the applied torque before
  scaling by inertia — releasing the stick gives full damping strength,
  continuously bleeding off spin; holding it fully zeroes the damping,
  granting full torque authority. Corrected the `drive` module's
  air-control doc comment and `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_SCALE`'s own doc comment,
  and added a forward citation from `FR-068`'s own Non-goals. Not adopted:
  unlike `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`'s own pitch/yaw/roll ratio, this port has no
  existing damping quantity to apply a ratio to — introducing one is a
  genuinely new mechanism, not a multiplier transfer — and its absolute
  coefficients are calibrated against real Rocket League's own specific
  inertia tensor, the same "false precision" reasoning that already keeps
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` a placeholder. No new tests; all 314 pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged.
- Confirmed `DODGE_DEADZONE` matches RocketSim's own real dodge-
  cancellation threshold (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-075`) — this spec's own Open
  Questions had claimed `DODGE_DEADZONE` "still has no public reference at
  all... so it may be off by a large factor," and `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-074`'s
  own Non-goals (mirroring `FR-073`'s identical earlier claim) separately
  framed RocketSim's all-or-nothing dodge-cancellation check as "a real but
  separate architectural difference" from this port's own independent
  per-axis trigger. Both were wrong: RocketSim's own confirmed check
  (already quoted verbatim during `FR-072`/`FR-073`/`FR-074`'s own
  investigations) fires iff `abs(yaw + roll) >= 0.1 || abs(pitch) >= 0.1`;
  since `FR-073` already folds yaw into this port's own `dodge_roll`, this
  port's own trigger is the identical boolean decision once
  `DODGE_DEADZONE == 0.1` — the same real value, differing only in an
  unobservable strict-vs-non-strict boundary comparison. Corrected
  `DODGE_DEADZONE`'s own doc comment, the module doc's dodge paragraph,
  this spec's stale Open Questions bullet, and `FR-073`'s/`FR-074`'s own
  Non-goals framing. No code change: this port's dodge trigger already
  matched real Rocket League exactly. No new tests; all 322 pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged.
### Changed
- `rb_verify_cli`'s `main.rs` is now a thin CLI wrapper over the new
  `lib.rs`; `rb-verify`'s output is a human-readable summary instead of a
  raw `Debug` dump, now including car-divergence stats.
- `rb_physics_bullet`'s `Sphere` type is replaced by `RigidBody` (with a
  `Shape` enum for sphere/box); `RigidBody::sphere(...)` replaces
  `Sphere::new(...)`.
- `rb_physics_bullet::PhysicsWorld::step` is restructured into Bullet's
  actual staged pipeline (integrate every body's velocity → resolve every
  contact → integrate every body's transform) instead of stepping each
  body fully in isolation, so ball-vs-car contact resolution sees the same
  pre-integration state ground contacts do.
- `rb_physics_bullet::collision::contact_between` is renamed
  `contacts_between` and now returns `Vec<Contact>` (was
  `Option<Contact>`), and `solver::resolve_contact_between` is renamed
  `resolve_contacts_between` and now takes a manifold slice (was a single
  `&Contact`) — needed to support box-vs-box's up-to-4-point case
  uniformly with sphere-vs-box's single point.
- `rb_physics_bullet::PhysicsWorld.car: Option<RigidBody>` is renamed
  `cars: Vec<RigidBody>` (breaking); `with_car` now appends instead of
  replacing, so it's callable any number of times to build a multi-car
  scene.
- `rb_physics_bullet::PhysicsWorld::frame()` now reports each car's
  current `ControllerInput` as `Some(input)` instead of always `None`.
### Fixed
- `rb_capture_ingest`'s synthetic test fixture had timestamps that didn't
  overlap the vendored replay fixture's real timeline (off by ~11.78s) —
  invisible under the old index-pairwise frame comparison, surfaced once
  real timestamp alignment landed. Corrected.
- `rb_physics_bullet::world`'s
  `a_ball_shot_through_the_goal_mouth_passes_the_standard_arenas_back_wall`
  test flew its ball for a fixed 3.0s regardless of when it actually
  cleared the back wall — harmless with the old, smaller `FILLET_RADIUS`
  (the ball drifted into `body::StaticQuarterPipe`'s documented
  infinite-along-its-axis zone far past the goal and got only a mild
  correction there), but `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-025`'s bigger
  `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` moved that same zone closer in and turned the brush
  into a solver-destabilizing correction that threw the ball back past the
  wall, failing the assertion. Shortened the test's flight duration to
  1.8s — still comfortably past the wall, short of the infinite-fillet
  zone.
- `rb_physics_bullet::solver`'s friction-direction selection
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-049`) — closes the divergence
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-048` found and left open: both friction directions
  were always derived from a fixed, velocity-independent `plane_space`
  basis, where real Bullet's actual default aligns friction direction 1
  with the tangential component of the current relative sliding velocity.
  A new `friction_directions` helper now does the latter, falling back to
  `plane_space` both for negligible tangential velocity (matching real
  Bullet's own `SIMD_EPSILON` threshold) and for a newly-found near-head-on
  catastrophic-cancellation edge case this crate's own panic-free
  `Vec3::normalize()` needed to handle but real Bullet's unguarded one
  doesn't. Wired into both `setup_rows` and `setup_two_body_rows`. 3 new
  tests, including a dedicated isotropic-friction regression test verified
  to fail under the old fixed-basis behavior; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- `net::NetMesh::step`'s body-vs-net-point contact resolution
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050`) — resolved every overlapping point
  independently and sequentially, an untested "net-point mass is tiny
  enough to not matter" assumption found false and, worse, genuinely
  order-dependent for a symmetric double-point impact (confirmed by a
  dedicated test), with a measured real-world residual of ~0.25 units/s
  out of a 2000 units/s impact. Adopted `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds`'s
  combined solve for every body-vs-point contact within a sub-step,
  reducing that residual roughly 15-fold to ~0.016 units/s; warm-starting
  deliberately left out of scope. 2 new tests; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- `PhysicsWorld::step`'s static multi-surface contact resolution
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-051`) — resolved a body's contact against each
  static shape type (ground, wall, curve, corner fillet, goal wall,
  bounded wall) independently and sequentially, the same
  independent-pairwise gap `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`/`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050`
  already proved under-converges. A dedicated test confirmed a ball wedged
  into a symmetric two-wall corner is genuinely order-dependent
  (mirror-image results depending on which wall resolves first). A new
  `solver::resolve_static_manifolds` generalizes `resolve_contacts` to
  combine every static-shape manifold a body touches into one shared
  solve; `step` was rewired to use it via a new `resolve_static_contacts`,
  replacing the old five-function-per-body call sequence
  (`resolve_plane_contact`/`resolve_curve_contact`/
  `resolve_corner_fillet_contact`/`resolve_goal_wall_contact`/
  `resolve_bounded_wall_contact`, all removed). 2 new tests, one confirmed
  to fail under the old sequential loop; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- `PhysicsWorld::step`'s static-vs-dynamic combined-solve ordering
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-052`) — resolved a body's now-combined static
  contacts and its combined dynamic manifolds as two separate solves, one
  fully resolved and applied before the other's own setup for that same
  body ever read the result, the same independent-pairwise gap
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`/`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050`/`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-051`
  already proved under-converges. A dedicated test reused FR-051's own
  symmetric two-wall corner setup with one wall replaced by a very-heavy
  dynamic body, confirming the old two-call order is genuinely
  order-dependent. A new `solver::resolve_manifolds` folds a step's static
  and dynamic manifolds into one shared solve; `step` was rewired to use
  it, replacing the two separate calls with one. 2 new tests, one
  confirmed to fail under the old two-call sequence; all pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged.
- `solver::combine_friction`'s missing defensive clamp
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-053`) — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043` fetched and read
  real Bullet's own `btManifoldResult::calculateCombinedFriction`/
  `calculateCombinedRestitution` source to correct this spec's wrong
  claim about the reference's default combine mode, but never separately
  examined one more detail in that same source: real Bullet's own
  `calculateCombinedFriction` additionally clamps its product result to
  `[-10.0, 10.0]`. Re-fetched and re-read `btManifoldResult.cpp` directly
  to confirm the clamp's exact mechanics, found it currently inert for
  every friction coefficient this crate itself ever sets (all positive
  placeholders in `0.1..=0.9`), and adopted it anyway for reference
  conformance since every static/dynamic body's own `friction` field is a
  public, unvalidated `f32`. `combine_friction` now clamps its average
  result to `[-10.0, 10.0]`, keeping the average formula FR-043 already
  decided to keep; `combine_restitution` stays unclamped, matching the
  reference's own choice. 1 new test; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- `collision::box_vs_goal_wall`'s corner-testing overlap question
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-054`) — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-028`'s own doc comment
  left open whether a car's face resting flush against the goal window's
  own edge, every corner just clear of it while the face's middle already
  overlapped it, could be under-detected the way `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-032`
  once suspected for a curved fillet. Resolved via a convex-hull
  argument: "every corner outside the (convex) window" is exactly
  equivalent to "the face doesn't fully fit through it," the correct
  block condition — no bug. The same investigation found the mirror image
  for `collision::box_vs_bounded_wall` *is* a genuine, currently
  unreachable under-detection gap (confirmed against this project's own
  car/ball sizes vs. the standard arena's own bound sizes) and documented
  it as a Non-goals item rather than fixing it. 2 new tests; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `drive::BOOST_ACCELERATION`'s missing ground/air split
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-056`) — this port's own single flat boost
  acceleration constant, and its own doc comments' explicit claim that
  boost "works identically airborne", were both found wrong by fetching
  RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` directly: the reference defines a
  distinctly higher `BOOST_ACCEL_AIR` (`3175/3` ≈ 1058.333) than
  `BOOST_ACCEL_GROUND` (`2975/3` ≈ 991.667, exactly matching this port's
  prior value) — a genuine split this port didn't model, understating
  every airborne boost by about 6.5%. Split into
  `BOOST_ACCELERATION_GROUND`/`BOOST_ACCELERATION_AIR`, wired
  `apply_driven_forces`'s existing `on_ground` parameter to select
  between them, and corrected every doc comment claiming the two were
  identical. 1 new test; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- Missing hard cap on a car's angular speed (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`) —
  nothing previously bounded how fast sustained air control torque (or a
  dodge's own kick, or the landing-orientation assist) could spin a car,
  so holding full pitch/yaw/roll indefinitely spun it arbitrarily fast,
  unlike real Rocket League. A second fetch of RocketSim's own
  `RLConst.h`, targeting every `drive.rs` constant this port's own doc
  comments flagged as having no public reference at all, surfaced
  `CAR_MAX_ANG_SPEED = 5.5f` (rad/s), a hard "can never exceed" ceiling
  this port had no equivalent for. Added `drive::MAX_CAR_ANGULAR_SPEED`
  and `drive::clamp_angular_speed` (a genuine clamp, unlike
  `MAX_CAR_SPEED`'s force-gating), wired in right after
  `integrate::integrate_velocities` in both `world.rs`'s production path
  and `drive.rs`'s own test helper. 3 new tests; all pre-existing tests
  pass unchanged.
- Missing real speed-dependent throttle taper (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`)
  — `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`'s own doc comment had named this exact gap
  since it was introduced: full flat acceleration right up to a hard
  cutoff at `UNBOOSTED_MAX_CAR_SPEED`, not a genuine taper. Fetching
  RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (not just `RLConst.h`'s constants) surfaced
  the real mechanism: drive force is scaled by a confirmed 3-point
  piecewise-linear curve (`{0, 1.0}, {1400, 0.1}, {1410, 0.0}`), not
  applied flat. Added `drive::DRIVE_SPEED_TAPER_BREAKPOINTS`/
  `drive_speed_taper` and replaced the hard cutoff with the real taper —
  `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`'s own peak magnitude remains an uncalibrated
  placeholder, only the curve's shape is now confirmed and modeled. 2
  new tests; all pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- Missing real forward-speed-dependent dodge impulse scaling
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`) — a backward or side dodge applied a flat
  `DODGE_SPEED` magnitude regardless of current speed or direction.
  Fetching RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (the same technique FR-058 used)
  surfaced the real mechanism: a dodge's impulse scales per-axis by a
  confirmed real ratio — `1.0` for a forward dodge (no change), `2.5` for
  a backward dodge (opposing current velocity), or `1.9` for any side
  dodge — as current speed rises toward `MAX_CAR_SPEED`. Added
  `drive::dodge_speed_scale`/`dodge_pitch_is_backward` and wired the
  scale into both the ground-dodge and wall-jump-dodge blocks —
  `DODGE_SPEED`'s own base magnitude remains an uncalibrated placeholder
  (RocketSim's real `500.0` base was deliberately not substituted, since
  the confirmed forward-dodge scale is exactly `1.0`). 5 new tests; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- `docs/specifications/physics/RB-PHYSICS-001-physics-core-port.md` and
  `drive.rs`'s own doc comments (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-060`) — `FR-057`'s own
  Non-goals had left open whether real Rocket League's auto-flip could map
  onto `drive::LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE` "without further
  investigation." Fetched and read RocketSim's real `Car.cpp` (the same
  technique FR-058/FR-059 used) and resolved it: real Rocket League has no
  mechanic matching "continuously nudge an airborne car upright with no
  player input" at all — it has two distinct, real, grounded, input-gated
  systems instead (auto-flip: a jump-triggered turtle-recovery flip past a
  roll threshold; auto-roll: a throttle-triggered ground-alignment
  torque), neither airborne nor input-free. Corrected the stale Open
  Questions bullet, `FR-057`'s own Non-goals bullet, and the `drive`
  module's doc comments accordingly. Zero production code changed; no new
  tests.
- Missing hard caps on the ball's linear/angular speed
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-061`) — the ball had no speed cap of any kind,
  unlike the car (`drive::MAX_CAR_ANGULAR_SPEED`, since FR-057). Fetched
  RocketSim's own `RLConst.h`/`Ball.cpp` (matching FR-057/FR-060's own
  method) and found two confirmed real hard caps: `BALL_MAX_SPEED =
  6000.f` and `BALL_MAX_ANG_SPEED = 6.f`, enforced by a hard clamp after
  collision resolution. Added `world::BALL_MAX_SPEED`/`BALL_MAX_ANG_SPEED`
  and `world::clamp_ball_velocity`, wired into `PhysicsWorld::step` right
  after this step's contact resolution — matching real RocketSim's own
  placement more precisely than the car's own earlier-in-pipeline clamp.
  `BALL_DRAG = 0.03f` deliberately not adopted, since real RocketSim sets
  it as a per-match mutator-config default at ball construction, not a
  hardcoded system invariant. 4 new tests; all pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged.
- Missing mandatory minimum-hold window for a ground jump's variable-height
  acceleration (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-064`) — `drive::JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`'s
  own doc comment had named this exact gap since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s
  original audit: real Rocket League scales its jump-hold acceleration down
  during a `JUMP_MIN_TIME` (0.025s) window rather than applying it flat, an
  unmodeled "two-phase ramp". Fetching RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`
  (`_UpdateJump`, the same technique FR-058/FR-059 used) surfaced the exact
  mechanism: the hold force keeps applying, scaled by
  `JUMP_PRE_MIN_ACCEL_SCALE = 0.62f`, for `JUMP_MIN_TIME` seconds
  regardless of whether `jump` is still held — even an instantaneous tap
  gets a small amount of extra height in real Rocket League, not just a
  release-anytime cutoff. Added `drive::JUMP_MIN_TIME`/
  `JUMP_PRE_MIN_ACCEL_SCALE` and reworked `apply_driven_forces`'s
  hold-acceleration check to derive elapsed time since the press from the
  existing `jump_hold_time_remaining` state instead of adding a second
  field, so no caller needed to change. 3 new tests; all pre-existing tests
  pass unchanged.
- Missing real per-axis air-control torque ratio (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-068`)
  — all three axes (pitch/yaw/roll) shared one flat `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`
  magnitude. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s own audit had already found real
  air-control torque coefficients exist but didn't adopt them (absolute
  torques calibrated against real Rocket League's own specific
  mass/inertia). Fetching RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (`_UpdateAirTorque`,
  the same technique FR-058/FR-059/FR-064 used) found the real mechanism
  is structurally identical to this port's own — a direct per-axis torque
  scaled by analog input — unlike steering or handbrake's own architecture
  mismatches, with `RLConst.h` confirming `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE =
  Vec(130, 95, 400)` (pitch-yaw-roll order). Added
  `drive::AIR_CONTROL_YAW_SCALE = 95.0/130.0` and
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_SCALE = 400.0/130.0`, wired into
  `apply_driven_forces`'s yaw/roll torque application; `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`
  itself (pitch's own magnitude) is unchanged, still uncalibrated. 2 new
  tests pin the exact expected angular velocity in closed form; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- Diagonal dodge faster than an axis-aligned one (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-072`)
  — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals had already found and flagged
  this gap: this port summed each dodge axis' own full-strength `(pitch,
  roll)` contribution independently, so a diagonal dodge came out
  `sqrt(2)`-ish times faster than an axis-aligned one, unlike real Rocket
  League. Fetching RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`)
  confirmed the real mechanism: `dodgeDir = btVector3(-pitch, yaw + roll,
  0).safeNormalized()`, normalized to unit length before any further
  speed-based scaling — a pure geometric operation this port's own model
  represents exactly, unlike a wheeled-vehicle model or a continuous-
  torque timing state. Added `drive::normalize_dodge_direction`, wired
  into both the ground-dodge and wall-jump-dodge code paths — the
  per-axis `DODGE_DEADZONE` trigger and `dodge_pitch_is_backward`'s sign
  check still read raw stick values; only the scaled magnitude changes.
  This port's own sign convention is kept and yaw isn't folded in, both
  already-documented, separate simplifications. Updated the two existing
  diagonal-dodge tests to assert the corrected magnitude and added 3 new
  tests for `normalize_dodge_direction` directly; all pre-existing tests
  pass unchanged, bringing the crate to 317.
- Dodge/wall-jump-dodge direction never read yaw input
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-073`) — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals (and
  `FR-072`'s own doc comment) had already found and flagged this gap: real
  Rocket League's own `dodgeDir` combines `yaw + roll` for its horizontal
  component, but this port's dodge read `roll` alone. Fetching RocketSim's
  own `Car.cpp` (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`) confirmed `controls.yaw` feeds
  nowhere else in the function — only `dodgeDir`'s own combined axis — and
  that this port already reads `input.yaw` in the same function for air
  control, so folding it into the dodge's roll-axis stick value
  (`roll + yaw`, each clamped individually first) needed no new machinery,
  the same "pure operation, no new architecture" transfer
  `FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-068`/`FR-072`'s own adopted findings share.
  Changed both dodge call sites in `apply_driven_forces`; the existing
  `DODGE_DEADZONE` trigger, `normalize_dodge_direction`, and speed scaling
  are otherwise unchanged. Added 3 new tests (a yaw-only dodge, a
  yaw-and-roll cancellation, and a yaw-only wall-jump-dodge); all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged, bringing the crate to 320.
- A near-axis-aligned diagonal dodge came out slightly off-axis instead of
  a clean single-axis dodge (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-074`) —
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-073`'s own Non-goals had flagged RocketSim's
  post-normalization small-component zeroing as "a separate, independent
  simplification," a mis-scoping this fix corrects: it's a further pure
  post-processing step on `normalize_dodge_direction`'s own
  already-computed normalized pair, needing no new machinery, exactly
  like normalization itself (`FR-072`). Re-confirmed via RocketSim's own
  `Car.cpp`: after `dodgeDir.safeNormalized()`, any component whose
  magnitude falls below `0.1` is zeroed, not re-normalized afterward.
  Added `drive::DODGE_DIRECTION_SNAP_THRESHOLD = 0.1` (a distinct
  constant from `DODGE_DEADZONE` despite sharing the same real value,
  since they serve different real purposes) and wired the zeroing into
  `normalize_dodge_direction`'s own return path — both dodge call sites
  already route through it, so no call-site changes were needed. Added 2
  new tests pinning the snap behavior at both sides of the threshold; all
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged, bringing the crate to 322.
