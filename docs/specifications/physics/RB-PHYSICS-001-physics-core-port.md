# RB-PHYSICS-001 — Physics Core Port

- Version: 0.5.0
- Status: In Progress (sphere-vs-plane, box-vs-plane, sphere-vs-box
  (ball-vs-car), and box-vs-box (car-vs-car) collision detection all
  implemented and tested, with a general 3x3 inertia tensor and a
  two-dynamic-body manifold solver path; multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support,
  driven car input, split impulse, warm-starting, and constant calibration
  are open follow-up work)
- Owners: baileyrd
- Depends on: RB-VERIFY-003
- Supersedes: none

## Purpose and scope

Define and implement the physics core that produces a simulated
`PhysicsFrame` sequence for `RB-VERIFY-003` to score, per
[ADR-0004](../../adr/0004-bullet3-source-port-for-physics-core.md): a
from-scratch Rust port of specific Bullet3 (zlib-licensed) algorithms —
rigid-body integration and the sequential-impulse contact solver — not an
integrated third-party engine and not an unguided from-scratch design.

**Implemented scope** (in `crates/rb_physics_bullet`): a dynamic sphere
(the ball) and a dynamic box (a car), each against a static plane (the
ground) and against each other. Gravity, damping, semi-implicit Euler
velocity integration, exponential-map orientation integration, analytic
sphere-vs-plane and box-vs-plane contact detection (the latter generating
a 1-4 point manifold depending on the box's orientation), analytic
sphere-vs-box contact detection (always exactly one point), a
separating-axis box-vs-box contact test (0 to 4 points — a clipped face
manifold or a single edge-edge point), and a sequential-impulse solver
with restitution and Coulomb friction (two tangent directions) —
resolving an entire ground-contact manifold together (`resolve_contacts`)
or an entire two-dynamic-body manifold (`resolve_contacts_between`) —
using a general 3x3 inverse inertia tensor (`RigidBody`/`Mat3`, see
Architecture) shared by both shapes. `box_vs_box` is unit-tested directly
but has no live caller through `PhysicsWorld` yet — see Non-goals.

## Non-goals (this increment)

- **Multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support.** `PhysicsWorld` still carries
  exactly one ball and one optional car, so `collision::box_vs_box` (two
  boxes colliding) has no real scene to run in yet — a second car
  colliding with the first never actually happens. Wiring this in is a
  distinct, larger decision (how many cars, per-car ground/ball contacts,
  team structure eventually) than "add the collision algorithm," so it's
  deliberately left as its own follow-up rather than folded into this
  increment.
- **Driven car input.** A car body here is a free rigid box — nothing
  couples throttle/steer/boost input into forces or torques on it yet.
  That needs a recorded input sequence to drive (`RB-VERIFY-002`) and is a
  distinct, larger "car driving physics" concern from box-shaped rigid-body
  mechanics alone.
- **Split impulse.** This port always takes Bullet's non-split contact-resolution
  branch (position and velocity correction combined into one `rhs`). See
  `rb_physics_bullet::solver`'s module doc for what this trades away.
- **Warm-starting and sleeping.** Every contact's impulses are re-derived
  from zero each frame. Documented consequence: a bouncy (restitution > 0)
  resting contact never truly settles under v0's solver — see
  `rb_physics_bullet::solver`'s module doc and
  `world::tests::resting_ball_stays_at_rest`.
- **Calibrated constants.** Gravity (-650 uu/s^2), restitution, and
  friction defaults are placeholders (commonly-cited community estimates
  or reasonable guesses), not confirmed against real Rocket League data —
  see `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`.

## Context and terminology

- **Physics core**: `rb_physics_bullet`'s `PhysicsWorld` — whatever
  produces a simulated `PhysicsFrame` sequence, the thing `RB-VERIFY-003`
  scores.
- **Port** (as in "ported from Bullet3"): a from-scratch Rust translation
  of Bullet3's algorithms, not a binding or vendored build — see
  `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Requirements

- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-001` (implemented): `rb_physics_bullet::simulate`
  given a `PhysicsWorld` (initial sphere + plane state), a duration, and a
  fixed timestep, produces a `Vec<PhysicsFrame>` `RB-VERIFY-003::score` can
  consume directly.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-002` (implemented): Rigid-body integration
  (`integrate` module) ports `btRigidBody::applyGravity`/`applyDamping`/
  `integrateVelocities` and `btTransformUtil::integrateTransform`'s
  exponential-map orientation update.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-003` (implemented): Sphere-vs-static-plane contact
  detection and resolution (`collision`, `solver` modules) — restitution
  via `restitutionCurve`, Coulomb friction via two tangent constraint rows
  clamped to the current normal impulse, matching
  `btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver`'s structure.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-004` (implemented): Extend to box-shaped car bodies,
  including their collision with the ball. Delivered: a general 3x3
  inverse inertia tensor (`Mat3`, recomputed from orientation each step
  via `RigidBody::update_inertia_tensor`, shared by both sphere and box
  bodies), analytic box-vs-plane contact generation (testing all 8
  corners against the plane — exact for a box vs. an infinite plane, not
  an approximation), multi-contact manifold resolution (the solver
  resolves all of a manifold's 1-4 points together, sharing one
  accumulated velocity delta, rather than one contact at a time), analytic
  sphere-vs-box contact generation (`collision::sphere_vs_box`, a
  closed-form closest-point-on-box query handling both the ordinary
  exterior case and a deep-penetration interior case), and a
  two-dynamic-body manifold solver path (`solver::resolve_contacts_between`)
  that carries both bodies' mass/inertia contributions instead of assuming
  one side is a static plane. `PhysicsWorld::step` now detects and resolves
  a ball-vs-car contact every step a car is present.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005` (open): Calibrate gravity/restitution/friction
  constants against real recorded ground truth once `RB-VERIFY-001`/
  `RB-VERIFY-002` produce real data, rather than relying on the current
  placeholder defaults.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-006` (car-vs-car collision, implemented — detection
  only, see Non-goals): A general separating-axis test between two
  oriented boxes (`collision::box_vs_box`), producing either a clipped
  face manifold (0-4 points) or a single edge-edge point, reusing the
  two-body solver path FR-004 introduced (`resolve_contacts_between` was
  generalized from a single contact to a manifold for this). Delivered as
  a real, unit-tested capability with no live caller yet: `PhysicsWorld`
  still models exactly one car, so this pairing never occurs in an actual
  simulated scene. Wiring it in (multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support) is
  tracked as separate, larger follow-up work — see Non-goals and Open
  questions.
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-NFR-001` (implemented): The physics core doesn't force
  Bullet-specific data modeling into `rb_domain` — `rb_domain::state`
  stays a plain state DTO plus general-purpose vector/quaternion algebra;
  `rb_physics_bullet` owns all rigid-body/solver-specific types.

## Architecture and interfaces

`rb_physics_bullet` (new crate, depends only on `rb_domain`):
- `mat3`: `Mat3`, a general 3x3 matrix — needed because a box's inertia
  tensor is anisotropic (unlike a sphere's scalar/isotropic inertia).
- `body`: `RigidBody` (dynamic; a `Shape` enum — `Sphere` or `Box` —
  picks the collision geometry and local inertia formula), `StaticPlane`
  (immovable). One `RigidBody` type serves both shapes, matching Bullet's
  own architecture (`btRigidBody` + a polymorphic `btCollisionShape`)
  rather than a separate rigid-body type per shape.
- `integrate`: force accumulation, velocity integration, transform
  integration — pure functions over `RigidBody`, shape-agnostic.
- `collision`: `contacts_vs_plane` — analytic body-vs-ground contact
  generation, dispatching to a sphere- or box-specific test and returning
  a manifold (`Vec<Contact>`, 0 to 4 points); `contacts_between` —
  dispatches to `sphere_vs_box` (0 or 1 points) or the separating-axis
  `box_vs_box` (0 to 4 points), covering every two-dynamic-body shape
  pairing this crate has.
- `solver`: `resolve_contacts` — sequential-impulse contact + friction
  resolution over an entire ground-contact manifold (one dynamic body vs.
  a static plane); `resolve_contacts_between` — the same sequential-impulse
  math generalized to two dynamic bodies' shared contact manifold.
- `world`: `PhysicsWorld::step`/`frame`, and `simulate()` — the
  composition root Bullet's `btDiscreteDynamicsWorld::stepSimulation`
  corresponds to, run in the same staged order (integrate every body's
  velocity, then resolve every contact — ground and ball-vs-car — then
  integrate every body's transform). `PhysicsWorld` carries one ball
  (`RigidBody`, always present) and an optional car (`RigidBody`, via
  `with_car`).

No `PhysicsStateSource`-style trait exists yet for "the physics engine"
specifically — `rb_verify_cli` calls `rb_physics_bullet::simulate`
directly. A trait is worth introducing once a second physics core
implementation actually exists to justify it (per the "no speculative
abstraction before two real call sites" convention this project follows
throughout) — not before.

## Data/state and invariants

World convention: +Z is up (matching Unreal Engine, which Rocket League
runs on). Sphere inertia is isotropic (`I = 2/5 m r^2`, same value on all
three axes); box inertia is anisotropic (`I = m/12 * (b^2 + c^2)` per
axis, from the box's full dimensions). Both are stored as
`RigidBody.inv_inertia_local` (a diagonal, in the body's own local frame)
and combined with the body's current orientation into
`inv_inertia_world` (a full `Mat3`) via `update_inertia_tensor` — called
once per step, after the transform integrates. A sphere's `inv_inertia_world`
is mathematically orientation-independent (`R * kI * R^T == kI` for any
rotation `R`), so this generalization doesn't change sphere behavior from
the previous scalar-only representation (see
`body::tests::sphere_inertia_tensor_is_orientation_independent`).

## Errors, failure, recovery, and observability

No fallible operations — `RigidBody::new` panics on non-physical input
(zero/negative mass, or a zero/negative radius or half-extent), matching
"trust internal callers, validate at real boundaries" (a physics body's
own constructor is such a boundary; a malformed body is a programming
error, not a recoverable runtime condition).

## Security, privacy, and compatibility

None beyond `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`'s zlib attribution obligations.

## Acceptance criteria

- Sphere (met): free-fall matches semi-implicit Euler kinematics before
  impact; an inelastic resting contact stays at rest; a dropped ball
  settles near the ground; restitution produces a bounce proportional to
  the combined coefficient; friction decelerates a sliding sphere and
  couples into spin.
- Box/FR-004 (met): free-fall matches the same kinematics as a sphere
  (shape-independent integration); box-vs-plane contact generation
  produces the correct point count for flat (4), edge-tilted (2), and
  embedded (4, positive penetration) cases; a box's inertia tensor changes
  with orientation while a sphere's doesn't; a box dropped flat settles on
  the ground without tipping onto an edge or corner (multi-contact
  resolution keeping symmetric contacts symmetric); a box resting flat
  with a small downward velocity settles to zero net rotation (no spurious
  torque from resolving 4 contacts one at a time). Sphere-vs-box contact
  generation is correct at the surface, under overlap, and for a sphere
  center embedded inside the box (pushed out via the nearest face); the
  two-body solver conserves linear momentum, produces no residual closing
  speed for an inelastic collision, and leaves a much heavier body
  (the car) barely moving from a much lighter body's (the ball's) impact;
  an end-to-end `PhysicsWorld::step` test confirms a ball shot at a
  stationary car actually bounces off it rather than tunnelling through.
- FR-006 (met, detection only): `box_vs_box` correctly reports no contact
  for far-apart boxes, a 4-point manifold with correct depth and normal
  for a symmetric flat overlap, a normal/depth pair antisymmetric in
  argument order (matching the sphere-vs-box case), and a partial
  (fewer-than-4-point) manifold for a non-flat rotated overlap; the
  generalized `resolve_contacts_between` settles two colliding boxes'
  face-to-face manifold without spurious net rotation, the same property
  already verified for the one-body ground-manifold case. All covered by
  `rb_physics_bullet`'s unit tests (62 tests as of this version).
- FR-005 (open): acceptance criteria defined when that work starts.

## Verification plan

Unit tests (existing) for physical sanity; `RB-VERIFY-003` divergence
scoring against real replay/BakkesMod ball *and car* trajectories once
`RB-VERIFY-001`/`RB-VERIFY-002` exist — that comparison is what actually
validates (or invalidates) the placeholder constants and this port's
fidelity to Rocket League's real ball/car behavior, not the unit tests
alone. In particular, no real data has yet exercised the box/multi-contact,
ball-vs-car, or box-vs-box collision paths at all — the unit tests confirm
internal physical consistency (a level box stays level, an anisotropic
inertia tensor behaves correctly, a collision conserves momentum), not
fidelity to a real car's actual resting/tumbling/hitting behavior.
`box_vs_box` specifically has no live caller through `PhysicsWorld` at
all yet (see Non-goals), so even that internal-consistency bar is only
met at the unit-test level, not through the composition root.

## Traceability

See [docs/traceability/TRACEABILITY.md](../../traceability/TRACEABILITY.md).

## Open questions

- Multi-car `PhysicsWorld` support — needed to give `box_vs_box` (FR-006)
  a real caller; a distinct scope decision (how many cars, whether/how
  cars also collide with the ball independently, eventual team structure)
  from "the collision algorithm exists," not started.
- Driven car input (throttle/steer/boost coupling into forces/torques) —
  needs `RB-VERIFY-002` capture data to validate against; not started.
- FR-005 above.
- Restitution/friction combine mode (`rb_physics_bullet::solver` currently
  averages; Bullet's actual default is `max` for both) — revisit once real
  data exists to calibrate against.
- No-split-impulse and no-warm-starting/sleeping are documented, deliberate
  gaps (see Non-goals). Now that ball-vs-car (and, once wired, car-vs-car)
  collision is real (not just ground contact), these matter more than they
  did before — worth revisiting once real recorded ball/car-hit behavior
  exists to compare against, rather than only the unit tests'
  internal-consistency checks (momentum conservation, no residual closing
  speed).
- `box_vs_box`'s edge-edge contact point uses the midpoint of the two
  closest points on the involved edges, and its face-contact clipping
  falls back to a single clamped-center point if clipping ever yields zero
  points (a defensive branch not exercised by real recorded data yet) —
  both are reasonable, tested choices, but neither has been validated
  against Bullet's own `dBoxBox` output or real car-vs-car contact
  behavior.

## Change history

- 0.5.0 (2026-08-29): FR-006 added and implemented (detection only) —
  `collision::box_vs_box`, a 15-axis separating-axis test (3+3 face axes,
  9 edge-pair axes) between two oriented boxes, producing a clipped face
  manifold (`face_contact`, 0-4 points) or a single edge-edge point
  (`edge_contact`, via a standard closest-point-between-segments
  construction). `collision::contact_between` is generalized to
  `contacts_between` (returning `Vec<Contact>` uniformly, since box-vs-box
  can now return a manifold where sphere-vs-box always returned at most
  one point), and `solver::resolve_contact_between` is generalized to
  `resolve_contacts_between` (a manifold, mirroring `resolve_contacts`'
  existing multi-contact structure) to match. `box_vs_box` has no live
  caller through `PhysicsWorld` yet — this scope still has exactly one
  car, so multi-car wiring is deliberate, tracked follow-up work, not this
  change's scope (see Non-goals). 4 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet`
  (62 total).
- 0.4.0 (2026-08-28): FR-004 completed — sphere-vs-box (ball-vs-car)
  contact generation (`collision::sphere_vs_box`/`contact_between`,
  handling both the ordinary exterior case and a deep-penetration interior
  case) and a two-dynamic-body sequential-impulse solver path
  (`solver::resolve_contact_between`, generalizing the existing
  body-vs-static-plane rows to carry both bodies' mass/inertia
  contributions). `PhysicsWorld::step` was restructured into Bullet's
  actual staged pipeline (integrate every body's velocity, then resolve
  every contact, then integrate every body's transform) so ball-vs-car
  resolution sees the same pre-integration state ground contacts do.
  `rb_domain::Quat` gains `conjugate` (needed to transform a world point
  into the box's local frame). Box-vs-box collision remains explicitly not
  implemented — see Non-goals. 11 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet`
  (58 total), 1 in `rb_domain`.
- 0.3.0 (2026-08-28): FR-004 substantially implemented — box-shaped
  bodies via a unified `RigidBody`/`Shape` design (matching Bullet's own
  rigid-body-plus-collision-shape architecture), a general 3x3 inverse
  inertia tensor (`Mat3`, shared by sphere and box), analytic box-vs-plane
  contact generation (1-4 points), and multi-contact manifold resolution
  in the solver. `PhysicsWorld` gains an optional car body stepped
  alongside the ball. Box-vs-sphere collision remains explicitly not
  implemented — see Non-goals. 21 new unit tests (47 total).
- 0.2.0 (2026-08-28): v0 implemented — sphere-vs-static-plane rigid body
  integration and sequential-impulse contact solver, ported from Bullet3
  per ADR-0004. Resolves the "build-vs-integrate" framing from this spec's
  0.1.0 open questions in favor of a direct source port.
- 0.1.0 (2026-08-28): Placeholder created at bootstrap; full spec deferred
  to Phase 1 start.
