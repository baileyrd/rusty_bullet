## The hit takes its real material and its extra kick
**2026-09-06** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-083` finding 5, closing `FR-063`

- The ball-car contact now solves with Rocket League's own pair
  values — friction `2.0`, restitution `0` — and car-car with `0.09` /
  `0.1`, through a `solver::PairMaterial` the world hands each dynamic
  manifold. Every pair without an override keeps the per-body combine.
  This is the "larger, separate change" `FR-063` recorded and deferred.
- **RocketSim's `Ball::_OnHit` kick, ported.** On the tick a car touches
  the ball, the ball gains `min(Δv, 4600)` times a `0.65 → 0.30` curve
  along a direction flattened by `0.35` and biased `0.65` away from the
  car's forward, applied after the solve and the nets and at most once
  per two ticks per car.
- **Measured on the fixture's hit.** The ball leaves at `(1566, 2407,
  957)` uu/s against the recorded `(1602, 2148, 790)` — flatter than the
  `(1548, 1983, 1057)` the default material gave, `8%` fast, the hit
  itself still one tick late. The isolated fixture goes `139.52 →
  117.41` uu and the ball `91.16 → 75.22` uu, back below where the
  wheels left it.
- `rb_physics_bullet` 383 → 389 tests, the workspace 444 → 450; the
  ratchet tightens to `< 125` uu on the car and `< 85` uu on the ball.

## Four one-liners from the diagnosis, each landing on its tick
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-083` findings 1–4

- Throttle now accelerates an airborne car along its forward at
  RocketSim's `THROTTLE_AIR_ACCEL` (`66.7` uu/s²); the jump hold is
  the full `JUMP_ACCEL` from the press tick itself (RocketSim's `0.62`
  pre-minimum scale is gone, on capture evidence); the flip's first
  torque tick fires on the press tick; and a car seeded mid-maneuver
  starts with its wheel drive fields primed from its recorded input.
- **Each measured on its own tick.** The first tick after the seed
  reads `314.2` uu/s against the recorded `314.0`; the post-jump climb
  is `+4.0` uu/s per tick as recorded; the dodge tick's pitch rate is
  `4.75` against `4.75`; the flight matches to `0.02` rad; and the
  car reaches the ball `16` uu behind instead of `45`, hitting one
  tick late instead of three. The isolated fixture goes `160.19 →
  139.52` uu.
- **Two more RocketSim-versus-RL residuals, recorded.** The recording's
  press tick carries no spring push (the port, like RocketSim, reads
  `8` uu/s high there), and the recording keeps its ground effect a
  tick longer after the jump. The ball figure rose `79.55 → 91.16` uu,
  as it had to: the earlier, faster hit under the default car-ball
  material sends the ball steeper. Finding 5 is next.
- `rb_physics_bullet` 382 → 383 tests, the workspace 443 → 444; the
  ratchet tightens to `< 145` uu on the car.

## Diagnosed the post-hit segment: a 45 uu lag, born in the air, reorders the jump and the hit
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-083`

- The port's car now reaches the ball, but three ticks late and
  mid-jump, where the recorded car hits on the ground and jumps the
  tick after. The lag is `45` uu, and it is born in the flight: with
  throttle held and boost off, the recorded car keeps accelerating
  along its forward at about `50` uu/s² — RocketSim's
  `THROTTLE_AIR_ACCEL`, `66.7` uu/s² forward whenever fewer than three
  wheels touch, which this port never had. One line, and the whole
  post-hit divergence hangs on it.
- **Six more, ranked by cost.** The recorded jump hold is the full
  `JUMP_ACCEL` from its very first tick (`+4.0` uu/s per tick, to the
  hundredth), so RocketSim's `0.62` pre-minimum scale that `FR-064`
  adopted is wrong on capture evidence. The recorded flip torque acts
  on the press tick, one tick before RocketSim and this port apply it
  — `0.046` rad of phase, the residual flight rotation error. A car
  seeded mid-maneuver should start with its engine and steer fields
  primed rather than a tick behind. The car-ball hit needs the real
  per-pair material (`FR-063`) and `Ball::_OnHit`'s extra impulse: the
  recorded ball leaves flatter and faster than the port's. And two
  things nothing can fix on this fixture: the capture's pitch input is
  missing at the second dodge at `6.05` s (the recorded impulse is
  exactly a forward-right diagonal while the record says pure right),
  and RL's wheels keep acting a tick or two longer after a jump than
  RocketSim's ray allows.
- No code changed; `443` tests unchanged. Next: findings 1–4 in one
  pass, then the hit itself.

## The car has wheels: real suspension, real tires, and the first ball hit
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-082` step (a)

- Four raycast wheels at RocketSim's Octane mounts on the real
  spring-damper suspension (`500`, `25`/`40`, front/back force
  scales, never pulling down), the half-g sticky force, and the
  `extraPushback` hard stop replace the box-on-floor stand-in. Tire
  forces are per-wheel impulses at the contact: Bullet's bilateral
  lateral grip and the engine/brake/coast rolling term, with the real
  speed-to-steer-angle curve on the front wheels and the real
  handbrake lateral factor. Three or more wheels touching is "on the
  ground"; the jump fires along the car's own up; the chassis meets
  the arena at its real mount now that the wheels hold it clear.
  `STEER_TORQUE`, `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`, and
  `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION` are retired, and `FR-065`/`FR-066` close.
- **Three corrections to the plan, found by measuring.** The tire
  mechanism could not wait for step (b): the wheels lift the box off
  the friction it used to drive on. Neither could the steer curve:
  with real tires and the old torque the fixture got *worse*
  (`239.55 → 310.89` uu), because the recorded car yaws faster and
  faster under full steer through the grounded ticks and unsteered
  tires fight any torque that imitates that; with the curve those
  ticks match to `0.00` rad. And `SUSPENSION_SUBTRACTION` is `0.05`
  *Bullet* units — `2.5` uu — so the pushback is a hard stop `2.5` uu
  past rest, not a term that would have put the resting car at
  `18.2`; read that way it ports cleanly and the landing bottoms out
  at `15.46` against the recording's `15.54`, rebounding `+17.5` uu/s
  against the recording's `+14` (`FR-081`'s "no bounce" was an
  overstatement).
- **The fixture.** `239.55 uu / 0.68 rad / 302.85 uu/s → 160.19 uu /
  0.44 rad / 264.09 uu/s`; the grounded ticks and the whole flight
  match to `0.04` rad; the landing reads `0.01`–`0.02` rad with no
  airborne read and no sideways dodge; and the port's car hits the
  ball at `t = 5.758` for the first time — `mean_ball_distance`
  `729.95 → 79.55` uu. What remains starts after the hit.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` gains a RocketSim (MIT) section: this is
  the first port of RocketSim control flow, not just its constants.
  `rb_physics_bullet` 359 → 382 tests, the workspace 420 → 443; the
  ratchet tightens to `< 165` uu on the car and `< 100` uu on the
  ball.

## The wheel and suspension model is scoped: the plan before the code
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-082`

- Everything left in the isolated fixture after the airborne phase —
  the post-jump velocity gap, the bouncing landing, the missed ball,
  and the hitbox offset against the floor — is one missing subsystem,
  and `FR-065`/`FR-066` had already found real steering and handbrake
  live in it. So, as `FR-080` did for the flip, the plan comes first.
- **The real mechanism, complete**, from RocketSim's `btVehicleRL.cpp`
  and `Car.cpp`: four wheels on `51.2` uu raycasts from the Octane
  mounts, spring-damper suspension (`500`, `25`/`40`, front/back force
  scales, never pulling down), tire friction as per-wheel impulses
  with lateral, handbrake, and non-sticky curves, an analog handbrake,
  the throttle/brake/coast rules, the speed-to-steer-angle curves, a
  half-g sticky force into the ground, a jump along the car's own up
  once three wheels touch, and auto-roll. One correction on the way:
  the spring rest is the declared length *minus* the `12` uu travel,
  so the springs sit `≈1.5` uu compressed, not `≈13`; the `12` is how
  far past rest the ray still finds the floor after a jump.
- **The constants land on the recording by themselves.** Balancing
  the four springs against the car's weight plus the sticky half-g
  gives a rest height of `17.03` uu against the recorded `17.0` (and
  `17.68` without the sticky term); the ray keeps the wheels touching
  until the car has risen `13.4` uu, the fixture's four ticks of
  post-jump throttle gain; the landing's `0.13` s no-bounce stop is
  the damping acting over the full travel while the spring only
  engages below rest.
- **Design, blast radius, sequencing.** Per-car wheel state, a raycast
  over the static scene, the chassis on its real mount for static
  contact, and `STEER_TORQUE`, `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`, and the
  central throttle force retired rather than tuned. Three steps: (a)
  flat-ground wheels with today's tire forces, (b) real tire friction
  and steering (closing `FR-065`/`FR-066`, and the ball hit), (c) the
  rest of the arena. The test churn will be the largest of any entry,
  because every grounded test encodes the box stand-in.
- No code changed; `420` tests unchanged.

---

## The car's hitbox is where the real one is, for every ball and car contact
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-081` finding 5

- RocketSim mounts the Octane hitbox `13.9` uu ahead of and `20.8` uu
  above the car's position, which stays its centre of mass and the point
  a capture records. New `body::CAR_HITBOX_OFFSET`,
  `RigidBody::hitbox_offset`/`hitbox_center`; `standard_car` mounts it,
  and `collision::contacts_between` — ball, cars, net points — meets each
  shape at its mount. The solver's lever arms stay on the centre of mass,
  as RocketSim's do (its inertia is the box's own about its centre).
- **The scoping correction that shaped this.** `FR-081` had sequenced the
  offset as measurable on the car's rest height. It isn't: the real car
  rests at `z = 17.0` on its *wheels*, hitbox floating `18.4` uu clear of
  the floor. A wheel-less box centred on the offset would rest with the
  origin `1.4` uu *below* the floor, so a car seeded from a recorded frame
  would fall `18` uu and the fixture's ground jump, `0.016` s later, would
  never fire. So contact with the static arena keeps the unoffset box —
  its underside `19.3` uu below the origin against the wheels' `17.0` at
  rest — as the wheel-support stand-in until the suspension model, and
  the offset against static surfaces goes with that model.
- Six new tests (the mount and its rotation; a ball that touches the
  offset hitbox but not the unoffset box, from both sides; two
  nose-to-nose cars likewise; a seeded car keeps its recorded position
  and reports it back unchanged; a car driving into the ball strikes it
  on the raised hitbox) and three sphere-vs-box arithmetic tests re-based
  onto an unoffset box — `rb_physics_bullet` 353 → 359, 420 workspace
  tests. The isolated fixture is unchanged to the last digit, as it had
  to be: its car never reaches the ball, and no static contact changed.
- Next: scope the wheel/suspension model as its own entry — findings 1
  and 4, `FR-065`/`FR-066`, and the static half of this offset in one.

---

## The dodge impulse is horizontal now, as the real one is
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-081` finding 2

- The cheapest of `FR-081`'s five findings: RocketSim applies a dodge's
  translation impulse along the car's *flattened* forward and right
  (`forwardDir2D`/`rightDir2D`), so a pitched or rolled car still dodges
  exactly horizontally at full speed. This port applied it along the
  car's tilted 3D axes, which at the fixture's dodge (nose `3°` down)
  leaked `-75` uu/s into vertical velocity. New `drive::dodge_axes_2d`
  feeds both the ground and wall-jump dodge paths; a car pointing straight
  up or down falls back to its 3D axes rather than dividing by zero. The
  flip torque keeps the real 3D body axes, as RocketSim's does.
- **Measured alone against the isolated fixture:** the dodge-tick
  velocity window `121 → 88` uu/s, the through-flight velocity gap
  `≈113 → ≈87`–`109` uu/s, whole-run mean velocity `≈337 → ≈303` uu/s and
  mean rotation `0.77 → 0.68` rad. Mean position is unchanged at `≈240`
  uu, exactly as diagnosed: the remaining `≈80` uu/s is finding 1's
  post-jump contact gap, and the ball is still untouched. Next is the
  hitbox offset (finding 5).
- Three new tests (`rb_physics_bullet` 350 → 353): a `30°` nose-down
  car's forward and side dodges are exactly horizontal at full
  `DODGE_SPEED`, the wall-jump dodge likewise, and the flattening plus its
  straight-up fallback. Full workspace green (414 tests); the ratchet
  holds at `< 250` uu.

## Diagnosed what's left in the fixture: five grounded findings, from a one-liner to a suspension model
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-081` (documentation only)

- With the airborne phase matched, the fixture's remaining divergence was
  traced tick by tick against the recording. It is a chain, not one
  mechanism:
  1. **The `≈110` uu/s velocity gap is born in the four ticks after the
     ground jump, not in the air.** The real car's wheels stay on the
     ground while its `≈38` uu suspension springs extend, and the tires
     keep applying throttle and lateral grip (`+77` uu/s in the recording).
     This port cuts every ground force the tick its box leaves the plane.
     That gap is why its car reaches the ball `172` uu behind.
  2. **The dodge impulse is tilted.** RocketSim applies it along the car's
     *flattened* forward/right; this port uses the 3D axes. At the
     fixture's dodge that put `-75` uu/s into vertical velocity the real
     dodge didn't have, and the flattened axes predict the recorded
     `Δv` to `1%`. A one-line fix per dodge block.
  3. **The recorded car hits the ball; the port's never does.** The ball
     leaves at `t = 5.758` in the recording. In the port it never moves —
     which is why the fixture's ball error has read exactly `729.95` uu
     through every fix since `FR-079`.
  4. **The landing is a suspension there and a bouncing box here.** The
     recording decelerates `vz` from `-312` to `0` over `0.13` s with no
     bounce and settles at `z ≈ 15.5`; the port catches a corner, spins
     up to `5` rad/s, bounces, hovers at `z ≈ 22`, and — reading airborne
     when the jump press comes — fires a `≈950` uu/s sideways dodge where
     the recording ground-jumps.
  5. **The hitbox is `20.8` uu too low and `13.9` uu too far back.**
     RocketSim centres the Octane hitbox `(13.9, 0, 20.8)` uu from the
     recorded position; this port centres it on the position.
- Ranked and sequenced: the 2D dodge axes first (cheap, isolated), the
  hitbox offset next (geometry only), then a wheel/suspension model as its
  own entry — the `btVehicleRL` subsystem `FR-065`/`FR-066` already showed
  this port's single rigid box cannot represent, and the only route to the
  landing and the ball hit. No grounded constant should be tuned before
  that; every one this port has sits on the wrong mechanism. No physics
  changed in this entry; full workspace green (411 tests).

---

## Real air-control damping replaces the invented landing assist, and the fixture's whole airborne phase now matches
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-071`

- Implemented the mechanism `FR-071` had documented and `FR-080` step (c)
  had pinned to real data: every airborne step, each body-axis component
  of the car's spin bleeds at RocketSim's `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING` — `30`
  about the right axis (pitch rate), `20` about up (yaw), `50` about
  forward (roll) — through the same `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE` the stick torque
  uses, the pitch and yaw terms scaled by `1 - |stick|` so a held stick
  meets no resistance (roll's isn't scaled, so full roll fights its own
  damping). It runs during a flip and under the post-flip pitch lock, at
  full pitch strength there, as the 77-tick fit required. New
  `drive::AIR_CONTROL_PITCH_DAMPING`/`AIR_CONTROL_YAW_DAMPING`/
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_DAMPING` and `drive::air_control_damping`.
- The placeholder landing auto-orientation assist (`FR-018`'s
  `LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`, an airborne, input-free nudge toward
  level) is removed. `FR-060` had found real Rocket League has no such
  mechanic — its auto-flip and auto-roll are grounded and input-gated —
  and what makes a tumbling car settle there is this damping. Measured
  both ways on the fixture with the real damping in: nudge kept `≈243`
  uu / `0.83` rad, removed `≈240` uu / `0.77` rad; a wash in the airborne
  phase, marginally better overall.
- **Measured against the isolated fixture:** the rotation gap now stays
  within `0.03`–`0.10` rad from the dodge through the flip window *and*
  the whole post-window decay to `t ≈ 5.52` s, with the velocity gap flat
  around `100` uu/s — the entire airborne phase matches the recording.
  Whole-run mean rotation `1.51` → `0.77` rad. Mean position (`≈237` →
  `≈240` uu) and velocity (`≈254` → `≈337` uu/s) went slightly up, and
  honestly so: the divergence now starts at the landing (`t ≈ 5.57` s),
  and a correctly-oriented car's grounded phase — landing contact,
  `FR-065`'s placeholder steering, the wall interactions after — diverges
  differently from step (c)'s wrongly-oriented one, which had happened
  to bounce closer for the last second. Nothing airborne is left in this
  fixture; the grounded phase is the next domain.
- 4 assist tests removed, 4 damping tests added (exact per-axis decay
  rates; held-stick exemption except roll; body axes not world axes; none
  while grounded), 1 `world.rs` test replaced (a tumbling car settles
  within 2 s), 19 flip/cancel tests re-pinned with the pre-step damping
  folded in — `rb_physics_bullet` stays at 350. Full workspace green (411
  tests); `rb_verify_cli`'s ratchet holds at `< 250` uu.

---

## The real flip cancel landed, and the flip window itself now matches the recording to a tenth of a radian
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-080` step (c)

- Implemented the last of `FR-080`'s three steps: flip cancel is now
  `FR-070`'s real mechanism. While the flip torque applies, holding pitch
  in the same sign as the flip's own pitch component scales that
  component — only that one — by `1 - |pitch|`, step by step (pull back to
  cancel a front flip); a roll-only dodge is immune and a diagonal one
  keeps rolling under a full cancel. `FR-016`'s jump-press cancel is
  removed: a second press mid-flip does nothing, as in RocketSim.
- The cancel changed nothing inside the fixture's flip window (the
  recorded pitch never meets the sign gate), so the rotation gap step (b)
  left there was run to ground at the tick — and both references lost:
  - **Air control stays live mid-flip.** RocketSim and RLUtilities lock
    all stick air control out during the flip. The recording's first flip
    tick changes `ω` by `(+1.75, +1.30, +0.03)` in the car's own axes
    where pure flip torque gives `(+1.53, +1.32, 0)`; the differences
    are the held roll's air-control torque and the real damping on all
    three axes, to two decimals. Over all 77 in-window ticks the
    references' model misses by `0.102` rad/s rms; flip torque plus
    yaw/roll air control plus `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING = (30, 20, 50)`
    with pitch zeroed misses by `0.0025`, the recording's own rounding
    floor. The port now keeps yaw/roll live through the flip.
  - **The angular-speed clamp belongs after the transform integration.**
    Before the flip the recording turns at exactly its reported `|ω|`;
    through the flip it turns `7.58` rad/s per tick at a reported `5.50`.
    That is RocketSim's `Arena::Step` order — `stepSimulation` integrates
    the transform with the unclamped velocity, then `_FinishPhysicsTick`
    clamps it (confirmed in `Arena.cpp`). This port clamped mid-pipeline
    and turned `5.50`, under-rotating every flip by `2` rad/s.
    `drive::clamp_angular_speed` now runs at the end of the step.
- **Measured against the isolated fixture:** the flip window's rotation
  gap is now `0.03 → 0.10` rad (from `0.05 → 1.33`); whole-run mean car
  position divergence `≈259` → `≈237` uu, max `≈528` → `≈459`, mean
  velocity `≈339` → `≈254` uu/s. Mean rotation rose `1.14` → `1.51` rad,
  and that is the honest shape of what's left: the recording's spin
  decays at `≈3.9` rad/s after the window under the air-control damping
  this port lacks (`FR-071`), so the simulated car — now spinning at the
  right rate through the flip — reaches the ground at a different
  orientation. Step (b)'s under-rotation had been masking that. The same
  77-tick fit pins `FR-071`'s constants, so it is next.
- 8 tests rewritten and 5 new (`rb_physics_bullet` 345 → 350);
  `rb_verify_cli`'s ratchet tightened to `< 250` uu. Full workspace green
  (411 tests). `FR-061`'s ball clamp is documented as sitting before the
  transform integrates; `Arena.cpp` shows it after — noted, not changed.

## The dodge is now a real flip: continuous torque to the cap for 0.65 s, and the fixture's car divergence dropped another 55%
**2026-09-05** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-080` step (b)

- Implemented the second of `FR-080`'s three sequenced steps: the
  instantaneous `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` spin kick is gone, replaced by
  RocketSim's own mechanism read from `_UpdateAirTorque` and
  `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`. A new per-car `drive::DodgeFlip { rel_torque,
  elapsed }` (replacing the `dodge_flip_active` flag in
  `apply_driven_forces` and `PhysicsWorld`) is set at the dodge from the
  normalized stick direction, `flipRelTorque = (-dodgeDir.y, dodgeDir.x)`
  symbol for symbol.
- Every airborne step for `FLIP_TORQUE_TIME = 0.65` s then applies
  `FLIP_TORQUE_X = 260` (roll) / `FLIP_TORQUE_Y = 224` (pitch) as an
  inertia-cancelled angular acceleration, per tick (`/ tickTimeScale`) and
  deliberately without `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE` — the reference's own omission —
  so the car reaches `MAX_CAR_ANGULAR_SPEED = 5.5` on the third tick and
  the existing cap holds it there for the rest of the window: the real
  "continuous flip torque" is *drive to the cap and hold*. Stick air
  control and the landing assist are locked out while it applies, pitch
  stays locked for `FLIP_PITCHLOCK_EXTRA_TIME = 0.3` s more, and
  `FLIP_Z_DAMP_120 = 0.35` bleeds vertical speed `×0.65` per tick from
  `0.15` s to the window's end (unconditionally before `0.21` s, only
  while falling after) — which under gravity settles at exactly the
  `-15.5` uu/s plateau the real capture holds. Landing clears the state.
- `FR-016`'s jump-press flip cancel stays as the interim until step (c):
  it now also ends the real flip (torque, pitch lock, bleed) and retracts
  the same step's already-accumulated flip torque — the rewritten cancel
  tests caught one tick of spin (`-1.87` rad/s) reappearing right after
  the zeroing without that.
- **Measured alone against the isolated fixture:** mean car position
  divergence `≈573` → `≈259` uu (`-55%`), max `≈2005` → `≈528` uu, mean
  velocity `≈744` → `≈377` uu/s; ball unchanged. The pre-dodge and
  dodge-tick windows are untouched. What remains now has a shape: the
  rotation gap grows inside the flip window (`0.05` → `1.33` rad) while
  both `|ω|` traces are pinned at `5.5` — an *axis* mismatch, exactly
  what the fixture's pitch stick held in the flip's own sign would produce
  through the real flip cancel's `pitchScale = 1 - |pitch|` — and the
  velocity gap only grows after the window. Step (c) is the next
  measurement; `FR-071`'s damping follows for the post-window part.
- 12 tests rewritten for the real timing (spin starts the step after the
  dodge), 8 new `drive.rs` tests (cap on the third tick and held through
  the window; per-tick invariance; lockout; pitch lock; the bleed window's
  four regimes; landing clears; a wall-jump dodge restarts) and 1 new
  `world.rs` test (`|ω|` and `vz` under real gravity) —
  `rb_physics_bullet` 337 → 345. `rb_verify_cli`'s ratchet tightened to
  `< 300` uu. Full workspace green (406 tests).

## The dodge impulse is now the real 500, and the fixture's car divergence dropped another 39%
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-080` step (a)

- Implemented the first of `FR-080`'s three sequenced steps: `DODGE_SPEED`
  is now RocketSim's own `FLIP_INITIAL_VEL_SCALE = 500.0`, replacing the
  `1400.0` placeholder that had stood since the dodge was first built. The
  name is kept (this port's convention is its own names citing the real
  one).
- Why the old "false precision" caveat never applied here: the dodge is a
  mass-independent velocity change (`apply_impulse` divides by mass and
  the call site multiplies by `car.mass()`), not a force or torque, so
  nothing about it depends on the placeholder car body. And the real value
  was confirmed to `~1%` from `FR-079`'s real capture: the recorded
  dodge-tick `Δv` is `≈620` uu/s; `500` with the confirmed side-speed
  scale at the recorded forward speed predicts `626`.
- Also added the one scale from the same RocketSim block `FR-059` hadn't
  adopted (confirmed absent by grep first): a backward dodge's forward-axis
  component carries `FLIP_BACKWARD_IMPULSE_SCALE_X = 16/15`
  (`DODGE_BACKWARD_SCALE_X`), multiplied on top of the speed ramp exactly
  as `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` does — so it applies at a standstill too.
- **Measured alone against the isolated fixture:** mean car position
  divergence `≈937` → `≈573` uu (`-39%`), mean velocity divergence `≈1369`
  → `≈744` uu/s, max position `≈2606` → `≈2005` uu. The `0.05`s window
  containing the dodge tick went from `≈1032` to `≈126` uu/s — the
  velocity jump `FR-079` left at the dodge was almost entirely this one
  constant. The pre-dodge windows are untouched (`0.03` rad), and what
  remains now grows steadily *after* the dodge: the spin-rate mismatch
  steps (b)/(c) address, plus `FR-071`'s post-window decay.
- One test updated for the `16/15` factor and one new standstill test;
  every other `DODGE_SPEED` assertion was symbolic and passed unchanged.
  `rb_verify_cli`'s ratchet tightened to `< 600` uu. Full workspace green
  (398 tests). Steps (b) and (c) remain scoped, not started.

## Scoped the real flip torque: it's "slam into the spin cap and hold it for 0.65 s"
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-080`

- Scoped adopting `FR-069`'s continuous flip torque — the dominant gap
  `FR-079` left — by reading the *complete* real mechanism from
  RocketSim's `Car.cpp`/`RLConst.h`, not just the torque line, and
  checking every piece against the isolated real fixture. Doc-only; no
  code changed.
- **The torque has no `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE`.** It goes through the same
  inertia-cancelled path `FR-079` built, but unscaled: `flipRelTorque *
  (260, 224)` integrated over a tick is a `Δω` of `≈1.87` rad/s (pitch)
  or `2.17` rad/s (roll) *per tick* — reaching `CAR_MAX_ANG_SPEED = 5.5`
  in three ticks and then held there by the per-tick clamp (which this
  port already has from `FR-057`) for `FLIP_TORQUE_TIME = 0.65` s. The
  "continuous torque" is really: drive to the cap along the flip axis and
  hold it.
- **The rest of the mechanism**: all stick air control and damping are
  off while flipping (except during a flip cancel); flip cancel is
  `FR-070`'s pitch-hold `1 - |pitch|` scale on the pitch torque only, and
  a second jump press does nothing; `FLIP_Z_DAMP` bleeds vertical speed
  `×0.65` per tick from `0.15` s to the window's end (unconditionally
  until `0.21` s, then only while falling); pitch stays locked for `0.3`
  s after the window; landing resets everything.
- **The real capture confirms every piece to the tick.** `|ω|` goes
  `3.40 → 5.22 → 5.50` in two ticks after the dodge at `t = 4.3167` and
  reads exactly `5.50` every tick through `t = 4.975` — the window end is
  `4.3167 + 0.65 = 4.967`. `vel.z` drops `222 → 131 → 24 → -5` from `t ≈
  4.467` (`FLIP_Z_DAMP_START`), then holds at `-15.5` uu/s until `t ≈
  4.967`: exactly gravity-per-tick over `(1 - 0.65)`. Nothing here is
  inferred from this port's own model.
- **A bonus constant, confirmed from the same data.** The recorded
  dodge-tick `Δv` is `≈620` uu/s; RocketSim's `FLIP_INITIAL_VEL_SCALE =
  500` with `FR-059`'s side-speed scale at the recorded forward speed
  predicts `626`. This port's `DODGE_SPEED = 1400` placeholder is `2.8x`
  too large — and it's a mass-independent velocity change, so the old
  "false precision" objection never applied. That is most of the `≈1030`
  uu/s velocity jump `FR-079` left at the dodge tick.
- **Proposed design**: `Option<DodgeFlip { rel_torque: (forward, right),
  elapsed }>` replacing `dodge_flip_active`, threaded like
  `jump_hold_time_remaining`; the spin kick removed; per-step flip torque
  through `apply_angular_acceleration` (divided by `dt / (1/120)` so the
  step is per-tick at any rate), vertical damping, pitch lock, and
  air-control lockout; the real flip cancel replacing `FR-016`'s
  second-press zero. Blast radius: 3 dodge-spin tests, 8 flip-cancel
  tests, `DODGE_SPEED`/`DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` removed, new tests for the
  cap-and-hold, the damping equilibrium, the pitch lock, and the
  direction-gated cancel.
- **Sequencing**, each step measurable alone against the fixture: (a)
  `DODGE_SPEED → 500`; (b) flip state, torque, z-damping, pitch lock,
  lockout; (c) real flip cancel. `FR-071`'s damping (the post-window decay
  the fixture shows at `≈3.9`/s) is next in line after that.

## Fixed the sign bug — in air control and the dodge — and the pre-dodge gap is closed
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`

- Implemented the pitch/roll sign fix the previous entry identified, and
  checked the dodge's own impulse/spin path while in there. It had the
  same bug, three ways.
- RocketSim's `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` builds `dodgeDir = (-pitch, yaw +
  roll)`, translates along `dodgeDir.x * forward + dodgeDir.y * right`, and
  spins with local torque `(-dodgeDir.y, dodgeDir.x)` (x = forward, y =
  right). So `pitch = -1` (stick forward) is a *forward* flip spinning
  about `+right` (nose down first), and a left dodge spins about
  `+forward`. This port had the pitch translation inverted (stick forward
  dodged *backward*), the pitch spin inverted, and the roll spin inverted;
  only the roll translation already matched. `normalize_dodge_direction`'s
  doc comment had recorded keeping "this port's own sign convention rather
  than the reference's negated `-controls.pitch`" as a deliberate choice —
  but the stick values this port replays come straight from real captures
  in the reference's convention, so that choice silently dodged every
  recorded forward flip backward.
- This also corrects the very first FR-079 finding: the dodge-frame
  velocity mismatch (`+X` real vs. `-Y` candidate) was primarily this sign
  inversion acting on a nearly-correct orientation, not accumulated
  orientation drift rotating a correct impulse.
- **The fix.** Air control applies pitch about `-right_axis` and roll about
  `-forward` (yaw unchanged). Both dodge blocks form `dodge_forward =
  -norm_pitch` exactly as the reference forms `dodgeDir.x`, and use it for
  the forward impulse, the spin about `+right`, and the backward-dodge
  classification (`dodge_pitch_is_backward` → `dodge_is_backward`, now a
  symbol-for-symbol match for `shouldDodgeBackwards`); the roll spin is
  about `-forward`. No constant changed.
- **Real-data effect: the pre-dodge gap is closed, and the aggregate
  finally moves.** On the isolated fixture, the last pre-dodge window's
  orientation gap went `~0.13` → `~0.03` rad (`~1.7°`) — `~0.22` →
  `~0.13` → `~0.03` across the three fixes, so the pre-dodge divergence
  this whole investigation set out to isolate is essentially gone. The
  whole-fixture car position divergence dropped `≈2792` → `≈937` uu
  (`-66%`; max `≈5919` → `≈2606`), rotation `1.63` → `1.39` rad, velocity
  `≈2177` → `≈1369` uu/s. What remains is now clearly post-dodge: the
  velocity gap jumps to `≈1030` uu/s at the dodge tick (`DODGE_SPEED`'s
  own placeholder magnitude, no vertical component) and the rotation gap
  then grows at `~2.5` rad/s — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s
  instantaneous-kick-vs-continuous-torque mismatch, now the dominant
  remaining piece.
- 12 `drive.rs` tests and 2 `world.rs` tests switched to real Rocket
  League's own stick convention (`pitch = -1` forward) and the real spin
  directions; nothing added or removed. `rb_verify_cli`'s known-bad
  baseline test became a ratchet (`cars.mean_position_distance < 1000`
  uu, set just above the new `≈937`) — it fails if this real replay ever
  gets worse, and should be tightened as fixes land. Full workspace green
  (397 tests).

## Isolated the residual gap: pitch and roll apply about the wrong sign of their own axis
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`

- Picked up the concrete next step the previous entry left open —
  isolating the residual `~7°` pre-dodge gap the inertia-cancellation fix
  didn't close — and found a further, separate, well-confirmed bug.
- Compared candidate vs. real angular velocity tick-by-tick during the
  isolated fixture's own second pre-dodge sub-phase (`pitch=-1, roll=-1`
  held, `t≈4.24`–`4.32`s, jump released). At `t=4.2417`, orientation
  distance between real and candidate is only `1.54°` — far too small to
  rotate a torque vector's world-frame direction by anywhere near `180°`.
  Yet the very next tick's angular-velocity change is already almost
  exactly the *negative* of the real one: real `(+0.056, +0.331)` vs.
  candidate `(-0.047, -0.332)` — nearly equal magnitude, opposite sign,
  on both axes simultaneously.
- Re-deriving the candidate's own predicted acceleration from its own
  formula reproduces its own (wrong-signed) output exactly — this port's
  code faithfully executes its own formula; the bug is in the formula's
  sign, not an implementation slip.
- **Confirmed against RocketSim's real source directly, not just
  inferred.** Fetching `Car.cpp`/`Car.h` shows `_UpdateAirTorque` doesn't
  use the car's plain `GetRightDir()`/`GetForwardDir()` for pitch/roll at
  all: `dirPitch_right = -GetRightDir()`, `dirRoll_forward =
  -GetForwardDir()` — the *negative* of the car's own right/forward axes.
  Only `dirYaw_up = GetUpDir()` is unnegated. This port's `drive.rs`
  applies pitch and roll about the *positive* `right_axis(car)`/`forward`
  — the same functions already correctly used, unnegated, for
  throttle/steering, so this isn't a project-wide axis-convention
  mismatch, only a pitch/roll-specific one. Negating the candidate's own
  predicted acceleration (equivalent to RocketSim's own double negation)
  gives `(+5.7, +39.9)` — matching the real `(+6.7, +39.7)` far more
  closely than the unnegated version ever could.
- Yaw was never affected by this bug in either real or this port,
  consistent with the earlier finding that Phase A of the same fixture
  (pure yaw input) already tracks real acceleration closely after the
  inertia-cancellation fix.
- Investigated via a temporary, never-committed example script (deleted
  after use, per this project's own established convention for throwaway
  per-frame investigation) plus a direct fetch of RocketSim's real source
  — no production code changed.
- What's still open: the fix itself (negate `right_axis`/`forward` for
  pitch/roll specifically) is scoped but not started — small in code
  size, but it flips visible pitch/roll behavior for every existing
  air-control test, the same threshold applied to the inertia-
  cancellation fix before it. Whether the dodge's own pitch/roll-direction
  impulse computation shares this same sign issue hasn't been checked
  either. See `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`'s own spec entry for the full
  writeup.

## Implemented the fix: air control now applies real Rocket League's own numbers
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`

- Implemented the architectural fix the previous entry identified but
  didn't yet make: an inertia-independent torque-application path for
  air control, matching what real Rocket League's own source actually
  does.
- `RigidBody` (`body.rs`) gained a second force accumulator,
  `total_angular_accel`, fed by a new `apply_angular_acceleration`.
  `integrate_velocities` (`integrate.rs`) folds it into `angular_velocity`
  directly (`+= total_angular_accel * dt`) — no `inv_inertia_world`
  multiply at all, exactly mirroring what real Rocket League's own
  inertia pre-multiply/cancel achieves.
- `drive.rs`'s three air-control constants were replaced with RocketSim's
  own real, unscaled `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` values directly
  (`AIR_CONTROL_PITCH_TORQUE = 130.0`, `AIR_CONTROL_YAW_TORQUE = 95.0`,
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_TORQUE = 400.0`), applied via
  `apply_angular_acceleration` and scaled by a newly-fetched real
  constant: RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` defines `CAR_TORQUE_SCALE = 2 *
  M_PI / (1 << 16) * 1000 ≈ 0.095882`.
- **A second, independent confirmation.** Computing the real car's own
  expected acceleration purely from RocketSim's real constants — no
  reference to this port's own model at all — predicts `95.0 *
  0.095882 ≈ 9.109` rad/s² for full yaw input. The recorded car's own
  independently-measured yaw acceleration from the same isolated-replay
  window: `≈9.12` rad/s². This is a tighter match than the old model's own
  internal self-consistency check ever managed, and it doesn't depend on
  this port's own formulas at all.
- **Real-data effect: measured, partial improvement.** Re-running the
  divergence-growth diagnostic at `0.05`s windows against the isolated
  `dodge-derailment.capture.jsonl` fixture shows the specific pre-dodge
  orientation gap this whole investigation targeted shrink from `~0.22`
  rad (`~12.5°`) to `~0.13` rad (`~7.4°`) at the same point — a real
  ~40% reduction, measured directly. The fixture's own *whole-trajectory*
  divergence didn't shrink to match (`cars.mean_position_distance` even
  rose slightly, `≈2449`→`≈2792` uu) — not a sign the fix is wrong: a
  residual gap still gets amplified by the dodge's own
  orientation-relative impulse, and `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s own
  separate, still-unfixed instantaneous-kick-vs-continuous-torque
  post-dodge spin-rate mismatch continues to dominate that aggregate
  score regardless of how small the pre-dodge gap gets.
- All 336 pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged — they
  assert qualitative behavior (direction, clamping), not the old model's
  exact values, despite the underlying acceleration magnitudes changing
  substantially (roughly 2-4x per axis). 2 new `integrate.rs` tests confirm
  the new accumulator bypasses `inv_inertia_world`; the three old per-axis
  air-control tests collapsed into 1 combined test against the new formula.
- What's still open: the residual `~7°` pre-dodge gap's own root cause,
  and `FR-069`'s continuous-torque flip model — both scoped as future
  work, neither started. See `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`'s own spec entry for
  the full writeup.

## Found the mechanism: real air control cancels its own inertia, this port doesn't
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`

- Picked up the concrete next step the previous entry left open — isolating
  the pre-dodge orientation-rate divergence's own root cause — and traced
  it to a specific, quantitatively-confirmed mechanism, not a scale error.
- Read RocketSim's own real `Car.cpp::_UpdateAirTorque` directly (fetched
  and grepped from raw source, not trusted from a summarized fetch): it
  computes air-control torque from stick input, then applies it as
  `applyTorque(invInertiaTensorWorld.inverse() * (torque - damping) *
  CAR_TORQUE_SCALE)` — pre-multiplying by the car's own *actual*
  (non-inverted) inertia tensor before Bullet's own integration divides by
  the inverse again. The two cancel. The same pattern appears at the
  dodge-torque and autoroll-torque call sites. Real Rocket League's
  `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` is, by construction, an inertia-*independent*
  direct angular-acceleration input, not a genuine physical torque.
- This port's own `apply_torque`/`integrate.rs` implement the standard,
  non-cancelling model (already confirmed correct against real Bullet by
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-046`) — so reusing a borrowed RocketSim constant like
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` through it silently divides the intended angular
  acceleration by this car's own moment of inertia, a step real Rocket
  League's own code never applies.
- **Quantitative confirmation.** This car's own `I_zz ≈ 330,581` (from the
  already-confirmed box-inertia formula) predicts a candidate yaw
  acceleration of `1,000,000 * (95/130) / 330,581 ≈ 2.211` rad/s² under
  the current model — matching the isolated fixture's own measured
  candidate value (`≈2.2` rad/s²) almost exactly, while the *real*
  recorded car's own measured acceleration over the same window is `≈9.12`
  rad/s² (a `≈4.1x` gap, matching an earlier, independent purely-empirical
  measurement of the same ratio).
- **Tried and rejected: a uniform rescale.** Temporarily multiplying
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` by `≈4.15x` improved the pure-yaw sub-phase but
  *worsened* pitch/roll and the whole-window aggregate — the anisotropic
  box has a different actual moment of inertia per axis, so one number
  can't fix all three under a model that still divides by inertia. This
  is documented negative evidence: the fix has to be architectural (an
  inertia-independent torque-application path), not a constant tweak.
  Fully reverted before commit; no production code changed.
- The actual fix isn't started — it's scoped as a Non-goal pending
  explicit go-ahead, since it's expected to touch many existing
  air-control tests that currently encode outcomes under the present
  model. See `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`'s own spec entry for the full
  mechanism writeup.

## Isolated the dodge: it's the maneuver, and it's more than one thing
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`

- Carried out the concrete next step the previous entry called for:
  replaying the real capture's abrupt-derailment dodge in isolation, from
  the exact recorded state right before it, instead of the whole run's
  own much-earlier kickoff seed.
- Built a new 347-frame real fixture,
  `crates/rb_capture_ingest/fixtures/dodge-derailment.capture.jsonl`
  (excerpted directly from the same real capture, `t=4.117s`–`7.0s`),
  starting at the last grounded, neutral instant before the recorded
  jump — the existing seed-frame heuristic picks it up as-is, no new
  production code needed. Seeding fresh here removes the whole run's own
  ~4 seconds of otherwise near-perfectly-tracked prior simulation.
- **Confirmed: the maneuver itself is the cause, not compounded drift.**
  The isolated replay still diverges sharply on its own (mean car
  position distance `~2449` uu over the isolated 347 frames) — recorded
  as a permanent regression baseline test,
  `rb_verify_cli::tests::isolated_replay_of_the_real_dodge_still_diverges_sharply`.
- **Refined the hypothesis into two parts, from reading per-frame data
  directly.** Orientation distance grows *smoothly*, starting from the
  ground jump itself and *before* the dodge fires — reaching `~12.5°` by
  the moment the second jump press triggers it. Since this port's dodge
  impulse is computed relative to the car's own current orientation, that
  modest pre-existing gap is enough to rotate the impulse into a
  completely different world direction: the real car's velocity gains
  mostly `+X`; the candidate's gains mostly a large *negative* `Y`
  instead. After the dodge, rotation distance shows a periodic beat
  pattern (rising toward `π`, falling to `~0.5` rad, and back, roughly
  every half-second) — the signature of a spin-*rate* mismatch, distinct
  from the translation issue and consistent with `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s
  already-documented, unimplemented continuous flip torque.
- This means the original single hypothesis (the dodge's spin kick alone)
  was too narrow. The real first departure is an as-yet-unexplained
  orientation-rate divergence during the grounded jump hold's sustained
  air-control input, *before* the dodge — that's the next thing to
  isolate, not the dodge's spin model on its own. No production code
  changed; `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005` still hasn't started. See
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-079`'s own spec entry for the full evidence chain.

## The divergence is abrupt: a dodge derails the run at ~4 seconds
**2026-09-04** · `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-004`, `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`

- Ran the divergence-growth diagnostic from the previous entry for real
  against `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077`'s own real capture (`test2.jsonl`) —
  independently reproduced bit-for-bit in this sandbox once the owner
  shared the capture file:
  ```
  t=   0.00s  frames= 120  ball mean/max=    0.04/    0.06 uu  car mean pos/rot/vel=    2.23 uu / 0.01 rad /     0.96 uu/s
  t=   3.00s  frames= 120  ball mean/max=    0.05/    0.05 uu  car mean pos/rot/vel=   33.81 uu / 0.06 rad /   164.41 uu/s
  t=   4.00s  frames= 120  ball mean/max=    0.05/    0.05 uu  car mean pos/rot/vel= 1314.54 uu / 1.37 rad /  2886.90 uu/s
  t=   5.00s  frames= 120  ball mean/max=   81.84/  659.64 uu  car mean pos/rot/vel= 4329.74 uu / 1.80 rad /  2796.35 uu/s
  t=   7.00s  frames= 120  ball mean/max= 4554.02/ 5673.98 uu  car mean pos/rot/vel= 7026.50 uu / 2.34 rad /  1854.51 uu/s
  ```
  (full 23-window table in `RB-VERIFY-003`'s Verification plan). Total
  frames (2,818) and the largest single-window max ball distance
  (`5673.98` uu) match `FR-077`'s own whole-run numbers exactly.
- **This answers the open gradual-vs-abrupt question: it's abrupt.** The
  first ~4 seconds track the recording almost perfectly (the car sits
  motionless at kickoff, trivial to match). Divergence then explodes
  within about one second and the ball follows a second later, after
  which both fluctuate in a persistently large but roughly bounded range
  rather than continuing to grow — two now-chaotically-independent
  trajectories in the same arena, not a runaway blowup.
- **Read the recorded input directly at that exact moment.** The car
  presses jump at `t=4.133` and holds it `~0.33`s, then — while still
  ascending — presses jump again at `t=4.317` with `pitch=-1, roll=-1`
  held: a diagonal dodge. This port's own dodge-trigger edge detection
  fires exactly once here, correctly, ruling out a repeated-trigger bug.
- **Leading hypothesis, not yet isolated or confirmed**: this port
  applies a dodge's entire spin as one instantaneous angular-velocity
  kick, while `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069` already found (but left
  unimplemented) that real Rocket League's flip spin is a continuous
  per-tick torque over a `0.65`s window shaped by the real inertia
  tensor — a structurally different mechanism plausibly responsible for
  exactly this kind of sharp departure.
- This gives `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005` a concrete, falsifiable starting
  point — replay this one dodge in isolation from the same seed state and
  compare this port's kick against a properly time-integrated torque
  model — rather than blind curve-fitting against a run that's a
  near-exact match before the derailment and fully decorrelated after it
  either way. `FR-005` itself hasn't started. No code changed; this is a
  reading of real data recorded in `RB-VERIFY-003` and `RB-PHYSICS-001`.

## Implemented the divergence-growth diagnostic
**2026-09-04** · `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-004`

- Built out the diagnostic scoped in the previous entry: a new
  `rb_domain::divergence::score_windows(recorded, candidate,
  max_timestamp_delta_secs, window_secs) -> Vec<(f32, DivergenceScore)>`
  partitions the same nearest-timestamp-matched frame pairs the existing
  whole-run `score` uses into consecutive `window_secs`-wide time
  buckets and scores each independently. `score` and `score_windows` now
  share a private `matched_pairs`/`score_pairs` pipeline internally, so a
  single-window run is guaranteed to reproduce `score`'s own numbers
  exactly — verified directly by a unit test rather than just asserted in
  the doc comment.
- A new `rb_verify_cli::score_capture_growth` and `rb-verify
  --self-growth <capture-file> [window-secs] [max-timestamp-delta-secs]`
  CLI mode expose it, sharing the same seed-frame selection and
  `simulate_recorded` call the existing `--self` mode uses (both now call
  a shared `seed_and_simulate` helper). Prints one line per window:
  start time, frames compared, mean/max ball distance, mean car
  position/rotation/velocity distance.
- 4 new tests in `rb_domain::divergence` (14 total: single-window run
  reproduces `score` exactly, a two-window run with a known offset in
  only the second window, a run whose earliest recorded frames have no
  match confirming the first window starts at the first *matched* pair's
  timestamp, and a run with no matched pairs returning no windows) and 3
  new tests in `rb_verify_cli` (9 total). Full workspace `fmt`/`clippy`/
  `test` green (395 tests).
- Manually run once against `rb_capture_ingest`'s synthetic capture
  fixture, confirming the CLI mode runs end-to-end: `t=11.78s frames=5
  ball mean/max=0.75/2.17 uu car mean pos/rot/vel=58.75 uu / 0.05 rad /
  600.40 uu/s` (a single window, since the fixture's 5 frames all fall
  within one second). This is **not** yet the diagnostic's real purpose:
  running it against `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077`'s own real capture
  (`test2.jsonl`, ~23 seconds) — the run that would actually show whether
  that run's large divergence grew gradually or abruptly — still needs
  the owner to do that on their own machine, the same as `FR-077`'s own
  run did.

## Scoped a divergence-growth diagnostic
**2026-09-04** · `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-004`

- The whole-run fidelity number from the previous entry (mean car position
  distance `4508.71` uu) can't tell us *why* the candidate engine diverged
  that much — a single mean/max pair over an entire ~23-second run
  collapses "many small modeling errors compounding" and "one early
  mechanic mismatch derailing everything after it" into the same number.
  Distinguishing those matters: `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005` (real-data
  constant calibration) needs to know which one it's looking at before it
  can decide what to tune first.
- Scoped (not yet implemented) `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-004`: a windowed variant
  of the existing scoring algorithm, `rb_domain::divergence::score_windows`,
  that partitions the same nearest-timestamp-matched frame pairs `FR-003`
  already computes into consecutive ~1-second time windows and reports a
  full divergence score for each — reusing the exact same matching logic,
  so a run whose pairs all land in one window reproduces the existing
  whole-run `score`'s own numbers exactly.
- Also scoped a new `rb-verify --self-growth <capture-file> [window-secs]
  [max-timestamp-delta-secs]` CLI mode, printing one line per window so
  the shape of the divergence — gradual or abrupt — can be read directly
  off the terminal, the same "read together" interpretive approach the
  previous entry's whole-run number already relied on. No automatic
  gradual-vs-abrupt classification is planned; a human reads the table.
- Recorded in `RB-VERIFY-003` (new Requirements entry, Open Questions
  updated) and cross-referenced from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`/`FR-077`. No
  code change yet — implementation is the next step, then a re-run
  against the same real capture from the previous entry.

## Ran the candidate engine against a real capture — this project's first genuine fidelity number
**2026-09-04** · `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077`

- The owner ran `cargo run -p rb_verify_cli -- --self test2.jsonl` on
  their own machine against the real BakkesMod capture from
  `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001` (2,818 frames), producing this project's first
  genuine fidelity number — a candidate trajectory actually simulated
  from the capture's own recorded input, scored against that same
  capture's own recorded outcome, unlike every prior `rb-verify` run
  (mechanical comparisons of two unrelated matches):
  ```
  frames compared:    2818
  mean ball distance: 2206.08 uu
  max ball distance:  5673.98 uu
  car pairs compared: 2818
  mean car position/rotation/velocity distance: 4508.71 uu / 2.12 rad / 1421.73 uu/s
  max  car position/rotation/velocity distance: 8798.56 uu / 3.14 rad / 3643.64 uu/s
  ```
- **A large divergence.** For scale, the standard arena's own half-width
  is `4096.0` uu and half-length `5120.0` uu; a mean car position
  distance of `4508.71` uu means the candidate ends up, on average, in a
  substantially different part of the field than the real recording.
  `Quat::angle_to`'s range is `[0, π]` (confirmed by this run's own max
  rotation distance of `3.14`), and the mean car rotation distance
  (`2.12`) is past `π/2` — worse than a uniformly random orientation
  would average. Read together, this is consistent with near-total
  trajectory decorrelation over the run's own ~23-second span, not a
  small, bounded fidelity gap.
- **Expected, not alarming.** Physics simulation is chaotic — any
  modeling error compounds over dozens of seconds of free simulation
  from one seed frame — and this port's own extensively self-documented
  gap list (uncalibrated placeholder constants, no tire-slip steering
  model, no per-axis air-control damping, anisotropic handbrake friction
  unmodeled, among others found across `FR-031` through `FR-075`)
  guarantees real modeling error exists. What this single number does
  *not* establish: whether the divergence is gradual (many small errors
  compounding) or abrupt (one early mechanic mismatch derailing the
  whole run) — that distinction matters for what constant calibration
  should target first.
- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`** (real-data constant calibration) still
  hasn't started: this whole-run number isn't yet the right shape of
  evidence to tune individual constants from. A follow-up diagnostic
  into divergence growth *within* this same run is the recommended next
  step, not blind curve-fitting against a fully-decorrelated trajectory.
- Recorded in `RB-PHYSICS-001` (FR-077's own entry gains a full
  Interpretation note) and `RB-VERIFY-003` (its "good enough threshold"
  Open Question updated to reflect that a first number now exists but
  doesn't resolve the question). No code change.

## Calibrated the crate's own tests to the real car hitbox (FR-078)
**2026-09-03** · `crates/rb_physics_bullet`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-078` implemented, verified.** Every existing
  `car_box`-style test helper across `rb_physics_bullet`
  (`body.rs`/`collision.rs`/`drive.rs`/`net.rs`/`solver.rs`/`world.rs`)
  that models a real car was switched from the old placeholder
  half-extents (`Vec3::new(60.0, 30.0, 18.0)`) to the confirmed real
  `body::CAR_HALF_EXTENTS` `FR-076` introduced but deliberately left
  every pre-existing call site on — closing the ~44% width discrepancy
  that FR surfaced rather than leaving it indefinitely deferred.
- An arbitrary shape unrelated to a real car (a unit cube, a symmetric
  pair of identical boxes for a tie-break test, a tiny corner-testing
  probe box) was deliberately left untouched, since it was never modeling
  this hitbox in the first place.
- Rather than hand-recomputing every downstream hardcoded expected value
  for an anisotropic dimension change (X +0.4%, Y +44.5%, Z +7.4%, unlike
  `FR-036`'s single-scalar ball-radius substitution), each test's own
  duplicate-literal dependency on the exact half-extents was refactored
  to reference the actual half-extents it constructed its own car from —
  then the full suite was run to find exactly which assertions still
  needed a genuine recompute, rather than trying to predict them all by
  static reading.
- Only resting-height thresholds (a car's `position.z` settling on its
  own half-extent, `18.0` → `CAR_HALF_EXTENTS.z`) turned out to need a
  real value change. Two solver-level tests' doc comments citing specific
  measured pinch velocities for a symmetric ball-vs-two-cars scenario
  were re-measured after the swap and confirmed unchanged — a purely 1D,
  mass/velocity-driven collision along a fixed contact normal has no
  dependency on the absolute half-extent value the contact happens to
  occur at.
- No new tests, matching `FR-036`'s own precedent for a pure
  constant-correctness change: all 335 pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet`
  tests pass unchanged; full workspace `fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test`
  green (388 tests workspace-wide).

## Wired the candidate engine into rb_verify_cli (FR-077)
**2026-09-03** · `crates/rb_verify_cli`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077` implemented; real-capture run pending.**
  `rb_verify_cli` gains `score_capture_against_candidate`: seeds a
  `PhysicsWorld` from a capture's own first grounded, neutral frame (a new
  `is_grounded_and_neutral` heuristic — proxying for `FR-076`'s unset
  hidden jump/double-jump/dodge state actually being accurate there),
  simulates it forward via `FR-076`'s `world::simulate_recorded` using
  that same capture's own recorded per-tick controller input, then scores
  the resulting candidate against the capture's own recorded outcome from
  that seed frame onward.
- Unlike every `score_replay_against_capture` run to date (a replay and a
  capture from unrelated matches, with no physical reason to resemble each
  other), this comparison has a genuine physical reason to be small if the
  physics core is accurate: the candidate was actually simulated from the
  same starting state and the same input the real capture recorded.
- A new `rb-verify --self <capture-file> [max-timestamp-delta-secs]` CLI
  mode exposes it, alongside the existing two-file mechanical mode.
- 3 new unit tests: a happy-path run against `rb_capture_ingest`'s
  synthetic capture fixture (which does contain a grounded, neutral frame
  0, exercising the whole path without needing a real capture), a
  missing-file I/O-error case, and a hand-built capture with no
  qualifying frame exercising the new `Malformed` error path. Full
  workspace `fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test` green (388 tests
  workspace-wide, 6 in `rb_verify_cli`).
- **What's still outstanding**: the one manual run this requirement's own
  scope calls for — against the real capture from `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`
  — hasn't happened yet. It needs a real Rocket League/BakkesMod
  environment this sandbox doesn't have; running `cargo run -p
  rb_verify_cli -- --self <real-capture-file>` there and reporting the
  resulting numbers back is the next step. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`
  (real-data constant calibration) doesn't start until that run produces
  this project's first genuine fidelity number.

---

## Implemented the candidate-engine plumbing scoped for FR-005 (FR-076)
**2026-09-02** · `crates/rb_physics_bullet`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-076` implemented.** `rb_physics_bullet` can now seed a
  `PhysicsWorld` from a recorded `PhysicsFrame` (`PhysicsWorld::from_frame`)
  and simulate it forward using a recorded per-tick controller-input
  sequence (`world::simulate_recorded`) — the two pieces `FR-005`'s
  real-data constant calibration needs before it can produce any fidelity
  number at all.
- `RigidBody::standard_ball()`/`standard_car()` centralize the car/ball
  shape and mass constants, fetched directly from RocketSim's own source
  rather than invented: `CAR_MASS_BT = 180.f` (confirms this crate's
  existing placeholder), `BALL_MASS_BT = CAR_MASS_BT / 6.f = 30.0` (new —
  existing placeholder was `1.0`), and `CAR_CONFIG_OCTANE.hitboxSize =
  {120.507, 86.6994, 38.6591}` full-size (new — surfaces a real ~44% width
  discrepancy against this crate's long-standing car hitbox test
  placeholder). Deliberately left uncorrected at existing call sites: a
  genuinely new confirmed constant doesn't get retrofitted onto pervasive
  pre-existing test literals outside the FR that adopts it; correcting
  those is left to a dedicated future calibration FR, matching `FR-036`'s
  precedent for the ball radius.
- `dt` per simulated tick is derived from each pair of consecutive recorded
  frames' own timestamps, not a fixed rate, since no confirmed real Rocket
  League physics-tick rate exists anywhere in this project yet.
- 13 new unit tests (6 in `body.rs`, 7 in `world.rs`); full workspace
  `fmt`/`clippy -D warnings`/`test` green (335 tests in `rb_physics_bullet`,
  385 across the workspace).
- `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-077` (wiring this into `rb_verify_cli` and running it
  once against the real capture, producing this project's first genuine
  fidelity measurement) remains designed but not started.

## Scoped the Phase 1 candidate engine FR-005 needs
**2026-09-02** · `docs/specifications/physics/RB-PHYSICS-001-physics-core-port.md`

- **Design only — no code.** With `PHASE-0-EXIT` closed, `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`
  ("calibrate constants against real recorded ground truth") is unblocked
  but has no way to actually run yet: nothing feeds a capture's recorded
  controller input into `rb_physics_bullet` to produce a candidate
  trajectory to score. Scoped that prerequisite plumbing as two new
  requirements.
- **`FR-076`**: extend `rb_physics_bullet` to seed a `PhysicsWorld` from a
  recorded `PhysicsFrame` (position/rotation/velocity/angular_velocity —
  `CarState`/`BallState` already carry exactly these four fields) plus a
  new `RigidBody::standard_car()` centralizing the car's confirmed real
  shape/mass constants (mirroring `RigidBody::ball()`'s existing pattern),
  and extend `world::simulate` to consume a recorded per-tick controller-
  input sequence instead of running input-free — the exact next step its
  own doc comment already named ("once `RB-VERIFY-002` capture data
  exists, this signature grows an `inputs` parameter"). `dt` per tick is
  derived from the recording's own consecutive timestamps, deliberately
  sidestepping the fact that no confirmed real Rocket League physics-tick
  rate exists anywhere in this project yet.
- **`FR-077`**: wire `FR-076`'s capability into `rb_verify_cli` (its first
  dependency on `rb_physics_bullet`) and run it once against the real
  capture from `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`, producing this project's first
  genuine fidelity number — scoring a capture's simulated-from-its-own-
  input trajectory against its own recorded outcome, unlike every
  `score_replay_against_capture` run to date (two unrelated matches).
- **Known limitation, called out explicitly rather than glossed over**:
  `PhysicsWorld` has no public setter for a car's mid-air jump/dodge state
  (double-jump availability, jump-hold timer, active dodge), so seeding a
  simulation is only accurate starting from a grounded, neutral moment.
  `FR-077` works around this with a seed-frame heuristic rather than
  adding those setters now; if that proves insufficient, adding them is a
  follow-up.
- Also corrected 35 stale "still blocked on `PHASE-0-EXIT`" Non-goals
  bullets scattered across earlier `RB-PHYSICS-001` FR entries in this
  same spec, now that gate is closed (the equivalent phrasing in
  `TRACEABILITY.md` was already corrected in the previous entry below).

---

## Ran the verification pipeline end-to-end on real data for the first time, closing all of Phase 0
**2026-09-02** · `crates/rb_verify_cli`

- **Fed the new real BakkesMod capture into `rb_verify_cli`**: `cargo run -p
  rb_verify_cli -- crates/rb_replay_ingest/fixtures/subtr-actor-sample.replay
  <real capture>` — `frames compared: 343, mean ball distance: 3640.81 uu,
  max ball distance: 6015.71 uu, car pairs compared: 343, mean car
  position/rotation/velocity distance: 4714.78 uu / 2.31 rad / 2127.93
  uu/s, max car position/rotation/velocity distance: 7721.40 uu / 3.14 rad
  / 3938.20 uu/s`. No errors; ball scoring, car scoring, and
  timestamp-tolerant alignment all engaged.
- **This is the pipeline's literal exit criterion, now met on two
  genuinely real inputs**: a real vendored replay and a real BakkesMod
  recording, not a hand-authored synthetic capture. Closes `PHASE-0-EXIT`
  and, with it, all four `PHASE-0-*` roadmap units (`BOOTSTRAP`,
  `REPLAY-INGEST`, `CAPTURE-INGEST`, `EXIT`).
- **The numbers themselves remain exactly as meaningless as a fidelity
  measurement as the earlier synthetic-capture run**, for the identical
  reason: the replay and this capture are two unrelated freeplay sessions
  with no physical reason to resemble each other. That was never this
  gate's own criterion — actually measuring fidelity needs a Phase 1
  candidate physics engine that consumes a capture's recorded input and
  produces a trajectory to compare against its recorded outcome, which
  doesn't exist yet (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`).

## Built, loaded, and fixed the BakkesMod capture plugin against a real game
**2026-09-02** · `bakkesmod-plugin/rusty_bullet_capture/`

- **Closed the one step that couldn't happen in a sandbox**: `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`'s
  BakkesMod capture plugin had only ever been source-written and grounded
  against a real SDK clone, never actually compiled or run — this required
  the owner's own Windows/BakkesMod/Rocket League environment. Built with
  MSVC (VS2022 Build Tools) + CMake, loaded into a real Rocket League +
  BakkesMod session, and run in freeplay.
- **A real capture surfaced a genuine bug no header file could catch**:
  the first real recording (9,358 lines) showed the ball's physics state
  updating correctly, but the car entry frozen — identical position,
  rotation, and all-zero input on every single line, even while the ball's
  own recorded velocity spiked mid-session (something clearly hit it).
  Root cause: enumerating cars via `ServerWrapper::GetPRIs()` +
  `PriWrapper::GetCar()` never picks up the live-driven pawn in freeplay,
  since a PRI's `Car` back-reference is meant for scoreboard/stat tracking,
  which freeplay has none of.
- **Fixed by switching to `ServerWrapper::GetCars()`** (inherited via
  `GameEventWrapper`), the game's own live spawned-car-actor list — the
  same source cameras/scoreboards use. A second real capture (2,818 lines,
  ~23.5s) confirmed both ball and car state update correctly with real,
  varied controller input (1,612 of 2,818 ticks with non-zero
  throttle/steer).
- **Verified two ways**: every line of the second capture schema-validated
  exactly against ADR-0005 (a Python check across all 2,818 lines, zero
  errors), and the whole file parsed end-to-end via `rb_capture_ingest`
  through a scratch integration test (not kept in the repo — the capture is
  the owner's own personal play data), confirming every car entry carries
  `Some` input in chronological order. This resolves both of
  `RB-VERIFY-002`'s former open questions (the hookable event name and
  whether ADR-0005's format is ergonomic to emit from BakkesMod's C++ SDK).
  `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`/`FR-002` are now implemented and verified; still
  open: a manual BakkesMod-overlay single-timestamp cross-check and
  NFR-002 (recording overhead, unmeasured).

## Confirmed the dodge deadzone already matches real Rocket League exactly
**2026-09-01** · [#157](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/157) · `2f5a3eb`

- **This spec's own Open Questions had claimed `DODGE_DEADZONE` "still has
  no public reference at all... so it may be off by a large factor,"** and
  `FR-074`'s own Non-goals (mirroring `FR-073`'s identical earlier claim)
  separately framed RocketSim's all-or-nothing dodge-cancellation check as
  "a real but separate architectural difference" from this port's own
  independent per-axis trigger. Both were wrong.
- **Re-examined RocketSim's own confirmed `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`
  cancellation check** (already fetched and quoted verbatim during
  `FR-072`/`FR-073`/`FR-074`'s own investigations, not a fresh fetch):
  `if (abs(controls.yaw + controls.roll) < 0.1f && abs(controls.pitch) <
  0.1f) { dodgeDir = {0,0,0}; }` — by De Morgan's law, a dodge fires iff
  `abs(yaw + roll) >= 0.1 || abs(pitch) >= 0.1`.
- **Derived that this port's own trigger is the same boolean expression**:
  since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-073` already folds yaw into this port's own
  `dodge_roll`/`wall_roll` (`roll + yaw`), and this port's trigger is
  `dodge_pitch.abs() > DODGE_DEADZONE || dodge_roll.abs() >
  DODGE_DEADZONE`, the two conditions are identical once `DODGE_DEADZONE
  == 0.1` — the same real value — differing only in an unobservable
  strict-vs-non-strict comparison at the exact boundary.
- **A pure documentation correction, zero behavioral change**: corrected
  `DODGE_DEADZONE`'s own doc comment (previously "Not a physics constant
  and not derived from any Rocket League value"), the module doc's dodge
  paragraph, this spec's own stale Open Questions bullet, and added
  forward citations from `FR-073`'s and `FR-074`'s own Non-goals
  correcting their "separate architectural difference" framing. No code
  change — this port's dodge trigger already matched real Rocket League
  exactly. No new tests; all 322 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

---

## Near-axis-aligned dodges now snap to a pure single axis, matching real Rocket League
**2026-09-01** · [#155](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/155) · `00039fc`

- **`FR-073`'s own Non-goals had flagged RocketSim's post-normalization
  small-component zeroing as "a separate, independent simplification"** —
  a mis-scoping this change corrects: it isn't a separate mechanism at
  all, but a further pure post-processing step on the exact normalized
  `(pitch, roll)` pair `drive::normalize_dodge_direction` already
  computes.
- **Re-confirmed RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`):
  after `dodgeDir = dodgeDir.safeNormalized()`, `if (abs(dodgeDir.x()) <
  0.1f) dodgeDir.x() = 0; if (abs(dodgeDir.y()) < 0.1f) dodgeDir.y() = 0;`
  — applied to the already-normalized direction, not re-normalized
  afterward.
- **Needed no new machinery**: like normalization itself, zeroing a small
  component of an already-computed pair is a pure post-processing step
  this function's own existing return value already supports — the same
  "pure operation, no new architecture" transfer
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-068`/`FR-072`/`FR-073`'s own
  adopted findings share.
- **Added `drive::DODGE_DIRECTION_SNAP_THRESHOLD = 0.1`** (a distinct
  constant from `DODGE_DEADZONE` despite sharing the same real value,
  since they serve different real purposes — a raw-stick trigger
  threshold vs. a post-normalization direction-snap threshold) and wired
  the zeroing into `normalize_dodge_direction`'s own return path. Both
  dodge call sites already route through it, so no call-site changes were
  needed.
- **A genuine behavioral fix, not a doc correction**: a dodge stick input
  that's nearly, but not quite, axis-aligned now snaps to a clean
  single-axis dodge instead of producing a tiny, physically negligible
  perpendicular component. Added 2 new tests pinning the snap behavior at
  both sides of the threshold; all 320 pre-existing tests pass unchanged,
  bringing the crate to 322.
- **Not adopted**: RocketSim's own all-or-nothing cancellation check
  (independent per-axis firing vs. one combined gate) — a genuine
  architectural difference, still left open, documented in
  `docs/specifications/physics/RB-PHYSICS-001-physics-core-port.md`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-074`).

## Yaw input now contributes to a dodge's direction, matching real Rocket League
**2026-09-01** · [#153](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/153) · `99a498a`

- **This port's dodge/wall-jump-dodge direction read `pitch`/`roll` stick
  input only, never `yaw`** — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals (and
  `FR-072`'s own doc comment) had already found and flagged this gap: real
  Rocket League's own `dodgeDir` combines `yaw + roll` for its horizontal
  component, so a yaw-only stick nudge (no roll held) should fire a
  sideways dodge, but this port's own dodge stayed silent.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`) and
  confirmed `controls.yaw` feeds nowhere else in the function — it only
  ever contributes to `dodgeDir`'s own combined axis, alongside `roll`.
- **Confirmed this needed no new machinery**: this port already reads
  `input.yaw` in the very same function, for air control — folding it into
  the dodge's own roll-axis stick value is a pure additive combination of
  an already-available input, the same "pure operation, no new
  architecture" transfer `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-068`/`FR-072`'s
  own adopted findings share.
- **Changed both dodge call sites** in `apply_driven_forces`: the combined
  roll-axis stick value is now `input.roll.unwrap_or(0.0).clamp(-1.0, 1.0)
  + input.yaw.unwrap_or(0.0).clamp(-1.0, 1.0)`, feeding the existing
  `DODGE_DEADZONE` trigger, `normalize_dodge_direction`, and
  `DODGE_SPEED`/`DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` scaling unchanged.
  `dodge_pitch_is_backward`'s own sign check still reads raw `pitch` only.
- **A genuine behavioral fix, not a doc correction**: a yaw-only stick
  press now fires the same sideways dodge a roll-only press would; equal
  and opposite yaw and roll cancel to no sideways contribution. Added 3
  new tests (a yaw-only dodge, a yaw-and-roll cancellation, and a
  yaw-only wall-jump-dodge); all 317 pre-existing tests pass unchanged,
  bringing the crate to 320.
- **Not adopted**: RocketSim's own all-or-nothing cancellation check and
  its post-normalization small-component zeroing — both separate
  architectural differences left open, documented in
  `docs/specifications/physics/RB-PHYSICS-001-physics-core-port.md`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-073`).

## Diagonal dodges are no longer faster than axis-aligned ones
**2026-09-01** · [#151](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/151) · `8f3fcd2`

- **This port summed each dodge axis' own full-strength `(pitch, roll)`
  contribution independently** — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals
  had already found and flagged this exact gap: a diagonal dodge (both
  axes held) came out `sqrt(2)`-ish times faster than an axis-aligned one,
  "a separate, independent behavioral question this requirement doesn't
  take on."
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`) and
  confirmed the real mechanism: `dodgeDir = btVector3(-pitch, yaw + roll,
  0).safeNormalized()` — normalized to unit length *before*
  `FLIP_INITIAL_VEL_SCALE` and the further per-axis forward/backward/side
  speed scaling (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own already-adopted finding)
  are applied.
- **Because normalizing a direction vector needs no new machinery this
  port lacks** — unlike a wheeled-vehicle model or a continuous-torque
  timing state — it transfers cleanly the same way `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/
  `FR-059`/`FR-068`'s own adopted ratios do, regardless of `DODGE_SPEED`'s
  own uncalibrated base magnitude.
- **Added `drive::normalize_dodge_direction(pitch, roll) -> (f32, f32)`**,
  wired into both the ground-dodge and wall-jump-dodge code paths in
  `apply_driven_forces`. The existing per-axis `DODGE_DEADZONE` trigger
  checks and `dodge_pitch_is_backward`'s own sign classification are
  unchanged (both still read the raw stick values); only the magnitude
  each axis contributes now comes from the normalized pair.
- Kept this port's own sign convention (`dodge_pitch` positive means
  forward) and did **not** fold in real yaw input's own contribution to
  `dodgeDir` — this port's dodge direction stays pitch/roll only, a
  separate, already-documented simplification.
- A genuine behavioral change, not a doc correction: a diagonal dodge now
  has the same total magnitude as an axis-aligned one, matching real
  Rocket League. Updated the two existing diagonal-dodge tests to assert
  the corrected magnitude and added 3 new tests pinning
  `normalize_dodge_direction`'s own behavior directly; all pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged, bringing the crate to 317.

## Real air-control damping mechanism (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#149](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/149) · `b4aa727`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-068`'s own Non-goals had already found RocketSim's
  `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING = Vec(30, 20, 50)` exists** but left it as "a
  separate, independent addition left for a future requirement" without
  examining the mechanism behind it.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` again** (the same fetch
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-070` used to characterize `pitchTorqueScale`) and
  found the full mechanism: for each axis, real air control subtracts a
  damping torque `(angular velocity along that axis) *
  CAR_AIR_CONTROL_DAMPING[axis] * (1 - abs(analog input on that axis))`
  from the applied torque before scaling by inertia — pitch's own input
  term additionally multiplies by `pitchTorqueScale`. Releasing the stick
  on an axis gives full damping strength there, continuously bleeding off
  any existing spin; holding it fully zeroes the damping, granting full
  torque authority with no resistance.
- **Not adopted as a fix.** Unlike `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`'s own pitch/yaw/roll
  ratio (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-068`), which scaled a torque this port already
  applies the same way, this port has no existing damping term at all to
  apply a ratio to — introducing one is a genuinely new mechanism, not a
  multiplier transfer. Its absolute coefficients are also calibrated
  against real Rocket League's own specific inertia tensor, the same
  "false precision" reasoning that already keeps `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`
  itself a placeholder.
- Corrected the `drive` module's air-control doc comment and
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_SCALE`'s own doc comment with the confirmed mechanism,
  and added a forward citation from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-068`'s own
  Non-goals.
- A pure documentation/audit finding: zero production behavior changed, no
  new tests; all 314 pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real flip-cancel is continuous, pitch-stick-driven, and pitch-axis-only (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#147](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/147) · `be2b755`

- **This port's flip-cancel (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`) triggers on a fresh
  jump press and zeros the car's angular velocity outright** — its own doc
  comment claimed this matched real Rocket League, but that claim was never
  checked against real source.
- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069`'s own fetch of `_UpdateAirTorque` had already
  surfaced a `pitchTorqueScale` factor**, scoped out at the time as "an
  additional speed- or state-dependent scale... didn't fully characterize."
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp` again to close that thread** and found
  real Rocket League's flip-cancel is driven by continuously *holding*
  pitch in the same direction as the flip's own pitch-torque component:
  `pitchScale = 1 - abs(controls.pitch)` scales down only that pitch-axis
  torque component, every tick, for as long as the flip continues — a
  continuous, proportional, pitch-only reduction, not a discrete jump-press
  trigger that zeros every axis. A sideways (roll-only) dodge has no
  pitch-torque component at all, so real Rocket League can't pitch-cancel
  it — this port's own cancel works uniformly regardless of dodge
  direction.
- **Not adopted as a fix.** This port's dodge is a single flat
  angular-velocity kick with no per-axis torque split to partially cancel
  (the same architecture gap `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-069` already found for the
  dodge's own spin), and reproducing the real continuous-hold trigger and
  pitch-only scope would need the same per-axis torque and
  elapsed-flip-time state `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals already
  flagged as out of scope.
- Corrected the `drive` module's flip-cancel doc comment (removing the
  inaccurate "matching real Rocket League" claim) and added a forward
  citation from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`'s own entry.
- A pure documentation/audit finding: zero production behavior changed, no
  new tests; all 314 pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real dodge spin is a continuous per-axis torque over a fixed window, not an instantaneous kick (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#145](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/145) · `46053ce`

- **`drive::DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` (`5.5` rad/s) applies a flat angular-velocity
  kick at flip start** — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s original audit had
  already found real reference constants (`FLIP_TORQUE_X=260`,
  `FLIP_TORQUE_Y=224`, `0.65`s) but not the mechanism behind them.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` and
  `_UpdateAirTorque`, matching this port's own established
  real-implementation-file investigation method) and found real Rocket
  League's flip spin is a *continuous per-axis torque*, not an
  instantaneous kick: `_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip` records a per-axis
  `flipRelTorque` once, at flip start; a separate, later step,
  `_UpdateAirTorque`, then applies `flipRelTorque * Vec(FLIP_TORQUE_X,
  FLIP_TORQUE_Y, 0)` every physics tick for as long as `isFlipping =
  hasFlipped && flipTime < FLIP_TORQUE_TIME` holds — a hard `0.65`s
  cutoff, with no decay or ramp before it.
- **Not adopted as a fix.** Real Rocket League's resulting spin rate
  depends on its own specific hitbox inertia tensor, which this port's
  placeholder car body doesn't match — the same "false precision"
  reasoning that already kept the constant a placeholder. Reproducing the
  real timed-torque *shape* (rather than just its magnitude) would also
  need new per-car elapsed-flip-time state threaded through
  `PhysicsWorld`, a redesign `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-059`'s own Non-goals
  already flagged as out of scope.
- Corrected `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`'s own doc comment (which had gone stale
  against this port's already-established spec-level finding), the module
  doc's dodge section, the "commonly-cited constants" paragraph, and the
  adjacent stale Open Questions bullet.
- A pure documentation/audit finding: zero production behavior changed, no
  new tests; all 314 pre-existing `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real per-axis air-control torque ratio (pitch/yaw/roll)
**2026-09-01** · [#143](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/143) · `77b047d`

- **All three axes shared one flat `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` magnitude** —
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s original audit had already found real
  air-control torque coefficients exist but didn't adopt them, since
  they're absolute torques calibrated against real Rocket League's own
  specific car mass/inertia tensor — the same "false precision" reasoning
  that kept `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` a placeholder.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateAirTorque`, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-064`/`FR-065`/`FR-066`/`FR-067`'s
  own real-implementation-file method) and found the real mechanism —
  `torque = pitch * CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE.x + yaw *
  CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE.y + roll * CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE.z` — is
  structurally *identical* to this port's own: a direct per-axis torque
  scaled by analog stick input, not a wheeled-vehicle raycast/tire-slip
  model like steering (`FR-065`) or a friction split like handbrake
  (`FR-066`) turned out to need. `RLConst.h` confirms
  `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE = Vec(130, 95, 400)` ("Angle order is PYR").
- **Because the mechanism matches, the confirmed per-axis *ratio* — unlike
  the real *absolute* torque values, which the pre-existing "false
  precision" finding already ruled out — is adoptable** the same way
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`'s throttle taper and `FR-059`'s dodge scale
  ratios are: a direct multiplier on a torque this port already applies
  the same way real Rocket League does.
- **Added `drive::AIR_CONTROL_YAW_SCALE = 95.0 / 130.0` and
  `AIR_CONTROL_ROLL_SCALE = 400.0 / 130.0`**, and redefined
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` (value unchanged, `1_000_000.0`) as *pitch's own*
  magnitude specifically rather than a flat value shared by all three
  axes. Wired both scales into `apply_driven_forces`'s yaw/roll torque
  application; pitch is unchanged.
- A genuine behavioral change, not a doc correction: yaw now produces
  measurably less angular velocity than pitch for equal analog input, and
  roll measurably more. 2 new tests
  (`yaw_air_control_is_scaled_down_from_pitch_by_the_confirmed_real_ratio`,
  `roll_air_control_is_scaled_up_from_pitch_by_the_confirmed_real_ratio`)
  compute the exact expected angular velocity in closed form from
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`/the new scale constant/`car().inv_inertia_world()`
  and assert the actual post-step value matches within `1e-3`. All 312
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged (none asserted cross-axis magnitude
  equality), bringing the crate to 314.

## Real Rocket League has no distinct wall-jump mechanic or constant at all (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#141](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/141) · `98f587a`

- **`drive::WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` had no public reference at
  all** — this port pushes a wall-jumping car outward along the touched
  wall's normal by this fixed speed, on top of the same vertical
  `JUMP_SPEED` every other jump variant uses.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateJump`, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-064`/`FR-065`/`FR-066`'s own
  method) and found real Rocket League has no separate wall-jump
  mechanic — or constant — at all. `_UpdateJump` applies exactly one
  impulse, `GetUpDir() * mutatorConfig.jumpImmediateForce` (the same
  real value this port's own `JUMP_SPEED` already matches), gated only
  on `isOnGround`, itself defined purely by wheel-contact count
  (`numWheelsInContact >= 3`) with no floor-vs-wall distinction at all.
  A dedicated search of `RLConst.h` for any `WALL`-named constant found
  only an unrelated Heatseeker-mode threshold.
- **Confirmed why the same impulse still ends up horizontal on a
  wall**: since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-065` already established real cars
  ride Bullet's own raycast vehicle system (`btVehicleRL`), a car
  driving on a wall has its own orientation continuously tipped to
  match that wall by ordinary wheel/suspension contact forces, the same
  way a real car tilts to match a ramp — so `GetUpDir()` (the car's own
  local up axis) already points along the wall's outward normal by the
  time a wall jump fires. Real Rocket League's "wall jump" is thus the
  *identical* single grounded-jump impulse, never a distinct
  horizontal-plus-vertical composite with its own separate magnitude —
  closing a thread `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s original audit only briefly
  noted ("a wall jump reusing the plain jump impulse rather than its
  own faster speed") without confirming the exact mechanism.
- **Not adopted as a fix**: this port's car has no wheels, raycasting,
  or surface-tracking orientation system at all (the same architecture
  gap `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-065` found for steering) — its own orientation
  doesn't automatically tip to match a touched wall. Applying only
  `JUMP_SPEED` straight up on a wall touch, as the confirmed real
  mechanism would otherwise suggest, would produce no push-off from the
  wall at all in this port's own model, defeating the entire point of a
  wall jump. This port's own two-component composite remains a
  deliberate, necessary substitute for the missing orientation
  mechanism, not an unfilled calibration gap.
- Also fixed while here: adjacent stale text in the spec's own Open
  Questions section that still framed `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` as
  having no public reference at all, and a "commonly-cited constants"
  paragraph that had only briefly noted the underlying fact since
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031` without the exact mechanism.
- Zero production code changed, no new tests. All 312 pre-existing
  `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real handbrake friction reduction is anisotropic, not a single uniform multiplier (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#139](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/139) · `45b107f`

- **`drive::HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER` had no public reference at
  all** — this port multiplies the car's own single isotropic
  `RigidBody.friction` by this factor while `handbrake` is held and
  grounded.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateWheels`, continuing
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-065`'s own investigation) and found real Rocket
  League's handbrake friction reduction is genuinely anisotropic: two
  separate confirmed real curves, `HANDBRAKE_LAT_FRICTION_FACTOR_CURVE`
  (`RLConst.h`, a constant `0.1` factor at every speed) and
  `HANDBRAKE_LONG_FRICTION_FACTOR_CURVE` (`0.5` at a standstill, `0.9` at
  and above 1 uu/s — effectively a near-constant, barely-reduced `0.9`
  for any real driving speed), are applied to lateral and longitudinal
  tire friction independently, not one shared multiplier.
- **A striking coincidence, not a confirmation**: this port's own
  pre-existing `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER = 0.1` happens to match the
  real *lateral-only* factor exactly. But this port applies that same
  `0.1` to its single isotropic friction scalar, which the ground-contact
  solver reads identically for every direction — so it also wrongly
  crushes longitudinal grip to a tenth, where real Rocket League keeps it
  near `0.9`. This port's own handbrake understates real forward-momentum
  retention during a drift.
- **Not adopted as a fix**: `solver::friction_directions` already
  computes two separate tangent directions per contact (since
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-049`), but both directions currently read the same
  single combined-friction scalar when their row limits are computed.
  Giving handbrake a genuinely different lateral-vs-longitudinal factor
  would mean threading a second, direction-specific friction coefficient
  through every one of `solver.rs`'s several row-limit call sites
  (`resolve_contacts`, `resolve_contacts_between`,
  `resolve_static_manifolds`, `resolve_dynamic_manifolds`,
  `resolve_manifolds`) plus a way for those call sites to know a specific
  body is currently handbraking — the same architecture-mismatch category
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-063`/`FR-065` already established.
- Also fixed while here: adjacent stale text in the spec's own Open
  Questions section that still framed `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER` as
  having no public reference at all.
- Zero production code changed, no new tests. All 312 pre-existing
  `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real steering is a wheeled-vehicle raycast model, not a torque (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#137](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/137) · `8a967c1`

- **`drive::STEER_TORQUE` had no public reference at all** — this port
  applies a direct yaw torque about the car's local up axis, scaled up
  with speed via `speed_factor`.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateWheels`, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`/`FR-064`'s own method) and found real
  Rocket League's steering isn't a direct yaw-torque model at all: a
  wheel's *steer angle* (not a torque) is set from a confirmed real
  `STEER_ANGLE_FROM_SPEED_CURVE` (`RLConst.h`, radians), and that angled
  wheel's lateral tire friction — computed per-wheel by `btVehicleRL`, a
  custom extension of Bullet's own raycast vehicle system — is what
  actually turns the car. This port has no wheels, raycasting, or
  tire-slip model (the car is one rigid box), so this mechanism can't be
  ported without a substantially larger architecture change — the same
  category `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-063` already established for
  per-contact-pair-type restitution/friction.
- **The confirmed curve's own shape is strikingly the opposite of this
  port's own `speed_factor`**: real maximum steering angle is highest at
  a standstill (`0.53356` rad ≈ 30.6° at 0 uu/s) and decreases sharply as
  speed rises (down to `0.03454` rad ≈ 2° at 3000 uu/s) — a car turns
  tightest from a stop, only gently at speed. This port's own
  `speed_factor` does the opposite: zero torque at a standstill, scaling
  *up* to full `STEER_TORQUE` at `MAX_CAR_SPEED`.
- **Not adopted as a fix**: unlike `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`'s throttle
  taper or `FR-059`'s dodge scale (direct multipliers on a force/impulse
  this port already applies the same way real Rocket League does), the
  real curve maps speed to a *wheel angle*, translated to actual turning
  force through nonlinear tire-slip friction this port doesn't model at
  all — there's no principled way to carry even the curve's normalized
  shape onto this port's own direct-torque model.
- Also corrected adjacent stale text in the spec's own Open Questions
  section that still claimed `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`/`JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`/
  `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION` had no public reference at all, contradicting
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`'s and `FR-031`'s own already-shipped findings.
- Zero production code changed, no new tests. All 312 pre-existing
  `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real mandatory minimum-hold window for a ground jump's variable-height acceleration
**2026-09-01** · [#135](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/135) · `e201222`

- **`drive::JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`'s own doc comment had named this exact
  gap** since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s original audit: real Rocket League
  scales its jump-hold acceleration down during a `JUMP_MIN_TIME` (0.025s)
  mandatory window rather than applying it flat from the first held step —
  "that two-phase ramp isn't modeled here."
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateJump`, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059`'s own real-implementation-file method,
  not just `RLConst.h`'s constants) and confirmed the exact mechanism: the
  hold force keeps applying, scaled by `JUMP_PRE_MIN_ACCEL_SCALE = 0.62f`,
  for the first `JUMP_MIN_TIME` seconds regardless of whether `jump` is
  still held — not a slower ramp, a hard step-scale, and applied
  unconditionally, not gated on holding. Even an instantaneous tap gets a
  small amount of extra height in real Rocket League. The reference's own
  inline comment flags this as a stopgap its authors consider provisional
  (`// TODO: Either move to RLConst or preferably don't use this system at
  all`), adopted anyway since it's still the real, currently-shipping
  behavior.
- **Added `drive::JUMP_MIN_TIME`/`JUMP_PRE_MIN_ACCEL_SCALE`** and reworked
  `apply_driven_forces`'s hold-acceleration check to derive elapsed time
  since the press as `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION - *jump_hold_time_remaining`
  rather than tracking a second, separate elapsed-time field — at rest
  this derivation already reads as comfortably past `JUMP_MIN_TIME`, so a
  car that never pressed jump never spuriously enters the mandatory
  branch, and no caller (`PhysicsWorld`, any existing test) needed to
  change.
- 3 new tests (the mandatory window's own scaled acceleration magnitude,
  its immunity to an early release within the window, and its on-schedule
  closure even when jump is never held). All 309 pre-existing tests pass
  unchanged — every existing hold-window test's own release/expiry timing
  happens to fall at or after `JUMP_MIN_TIME` has already elapsed, so none
  exercised this exact case before. 312 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+3
  over FR-063's 309).

## Real Rocket League uses per-contact-pair-type restitution/friction (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#133](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/133) · `0483b46`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043` had left open** which formula matches real
  Rocket League for `solver::combine_restitution`/`combine_friction`
  (this port's own average, kept over Bullet's real unclamped-product
  default).
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `RLConst.h`** (matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`/`FR-060`/`FR-061`/`FR-062`'s own method) and
  found the real answer isn't a different formula at all: real Rocket
  League hardcodes a distinct restitution/friction value per named
  contact-pair type, overriding whatever a generic per-body combine would
  produce — `CARWORLD_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION = 0.3f`/`0.3f`,
  `CARCAR_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION = 0.09f`/`0.1f`, and
  `CARBALL_COLLISION_FRICTION/RESTITUTION = 2.0f`/`0.0f`.
- **Two findings stand out**: a car hitting the ball has **zero**
  restitution-driven bounce in real Rocket League regardless of either
  body's own material (this port's own combine currently averages the
  ball's confirmed real `0.6` against the car's generic `0.5` to `~0.55`
  for that exact pairing); and car-vs-ball friction is **above `1.0`**, a
  value no combine of two bodies' own sane per-material values could ever
  produce.
- **Corrected `combine_restitution`/`combine_friction`'s own doc
  comments** and this spec's stale Open Questions bullet to state this
  finding directly.
- **Explicitly not adopted**: implementing real per-pair-type overrides
  — `combine_restitution`/`combine_friction`'s own two-`f32`-in-one-out
  signature has no way to know which kind of pair produced its inputs;
  doing so for real would mean threading body/shape identity into every
  one of `solver.rs`'s several call sites, left for a future, dedicated
  requirement. Also not adopted: setting the car's own generic default
  restitution/friction to any of these values (mirroring
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-062`'s `RigidBody::ball`) — unlike the ball, every
  real value found here is contact-pair-specific, so picking one for a
  generic default would be arbitrary.
- No behavioral change and no new tests (documentation-only, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-044`/`FR-060`'s own precedent); all 309 pre-existing
  `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real ball material properties via a new `RigidBody::ball` constructor
**2026-09-01** · [#131](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/131) · `a1a0812`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-061`'s own Non-goals had deferred adopting
  `BALL_DRAG`** for lack of a dedicated ball-construction API — `sphere`
  gives every caller an identical generic `restitution = 0.5`/`friction =
  0.5`/`linear_damping = 0.0` placeholder, with no way to say "this one
  is a real ball."
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `RLConst.h`** (matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`/`FR-060`/`FR-061`'s own method) and confirmed
  three real material-property constants: `BALL_RESTITUTION = 0.6f`
  ("Bounce factor"), `BALL_FRICTION = 0.35f`, and `BALL_DRAG = 0.03f`
  ("Net-velocity drag multiplier") — none a torque or force calibrated
  against a specific mass/inertia, so all three transfer cleanly the same
  way `FR-061`'s speed caps did.
- **Added `body::RigidBody::ball(radius, mass, position)`**, new,
  additive API alongside the existing `sphere`/`car_box`: identical for
  `radius`/`mass`/`position`, but sets `restitution = 0.6`, `friction =
  0.35`, and `linear_damping = 0.03` instead of the generic placeholders.
  `sphere` itself is unchanged — every existing test's own non-ball
  spheres, and any test that deliberately wants a non-real ball, keep
  working exactly as before.
- **Explicitly not adopted**: `BALL_MASS_BT = CAR_MASS_BT / 6.f` — while
  the `1:6` ratio is in principle a portable, dimensionless quantity, this
  project has no canonical "real" car construction site yet (no game
  binary consumes this crate; every `car_box` call site today is
  test-only) to normalize that ratio against — left for a future
  requirement.
- 3 new tests (`ball_sets_confirmed_real_material_properties`,
  `ball_otherwise_behaves_identically_to_sphere`, and a regression pin
  confirming `sphere`'s own default stayed untouched). All pre-existing
  tests pass unchanged. 309 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+3 over
  FR-061's 306).

## Hard caps on ball linear/angular speed
**2026-09-01** · [#129](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/129) · `b5eefa6`

- **The ball had no linear or angular speed cap of any kind** — unlike the
  car, which has had a hard angular-speed ceiling since
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`, the ball's `RigidBody.linear_damping`/
  `angular_damping` both default to `0.0` and nothing else ever bounded
  its velocity.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` and `Ball.cpp`** (matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`/`FR-060`'s own method) and found two confirmed
  real hard caps: `BALL_MAX_SPEED = 6000.f` and `BALL_MAX_ANG_SPEED =
  6.f`, enforced via a hard clamp after collision resolution, at the end
  of the physics tick.
- **Added `world::BALL_MAX_SPEED`/`BALL_MAX_ANG_SPEED` and a new
  `world::clamp_ball_velocity`**, generalizing `drive::clamp_angular_speed`'s
  own shape to both linear and angular speed, wired into
  `PhysicsWorld::step` right after this step's contact resolution —
  matching real RocketSim's own placement more precisely than the car's
  own earlier-in-pipeline clamp.
- **Explicitly not adopted**: `BALL_DRAG = 0.03f`, since real RocketSim
  sets it once at ball construction as a per-match mutator-config
  default, not a hardcoded system invariant like the two speed caps —
  this port's own ball-construction API takes no opinion on that default,
  and changing it is a separate, deliberate design decision left for a
  future requirement.
- 4 new tests (2 unit tests of `clamp_ball_velocity` directly, one each
  for linear and angular; 1 integration test through `PhysicsWorld::step`;

## Landing auto-orientation vs. real auto-flip/auto-roll (audit finding)
**2026-09-01** · [#127](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/127) · `6348835`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-057`'s own Non-goals had left open** whether real
  Rocket League's auto-flip (`CAR_AUTOFLIP_IMPULSE/TORQUE/TIME/
  NORMZ_THRESH/ROLL_THRESH`) could map onto this port's own
  `drive::LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE` "without further investigation."
- **Fetched and read RocketSim's real `Car.cpp`** (the same technique
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058`/`FR-059` used) and resolved that investigation:
  real Rocket League has no mechanic matching "continuously nudge an
  airborne car upright with no player input" at all.
- **Found two distinct, real, grounded, input-gated systems instead**:
  **auto-flip** — a turtle-recovery flip firing only on a jump press while
  grounded on a roughly-horizontal surface with roll past a threshold,
  timed over `CAR_AUTOFLIP_TIME` — and **auto-roll** — a continuous
  ground-alignment torque active only while throttle is held with wheel
  contact. Neither is airborne or input-free, the opposite shape from this
  port's own placeholder.
- **Corrected the `drive` module's doc comments**, this spec's stale Open
  Questions bullet, and `FR-057`'s own Non-goals bullet to state this
  finding directly instead of leaving it an open question.
- No behavioral change and no new tests (documentation-only, matching
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-044`'s own precedent); all 302 pre-existing
  `rb_physics_bullet` tests pass unchanged.

## Real forward-speed-dependent dodge impulse scaling
**2026-09-01** · [#125](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/125) · `5f20ac4`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s own audit had already found real Rocket
  League's dodge impulse has "direction/speed-dependent scaling"** but
  couldn't adopt it — the audit only had `RLConst.h`'s bare constant
  declarations, not the formula they combine into.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (`_UpdateDoubleJumpOrFlip`, the
  same file/technique `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-058` used for the throttle
  taper) and found the real mechanism: a dodge's base impulse scales
  per-axis by `((maxSpeedScale - 1) * forwardSpeedRatio) + 1`, where
  `maxSpeedScale` is `1.f` for a forward dodge (no change, ever), `2.5f`
  for a backward dodge (opposing the car's current velocity direction,
  per `shouldDodgeBackwards`), or `1.9f` for any side (roll) dodge.
- **Adopted the confirmed real *ratios* (`2.5`, `1.9`), not the real base
  magnitude (`500.f`)** — since the real forward-dodge scale is exactly
  `1.0`, this port's own existing (still-uncalibrated) `DODGE_SPEED =
  1400.0` already stands in for that case unchanged, the same "shape
  confirmed, magnitude not" split FR-058 established for
  `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`.
- **Added `drive::dodge_speed_scale`/`dodge_pitch_is_backward`** (the
  second re-derived in this port's own pitch-sign convention rather than
  translated symbol-for-symbol from the reference) and wired the scale
  into both the ground-dodge and wall-jump-dodge blocks.
- **Explicitly not adopted**: RocketSim's own diagonal-dodge direction
  normalization (this port's own pre-existing, already-documented
  simplification — pitch and roll still contribute independently rather
  than being normalized into one direction) and its
  continuous-torque-over-`FLIP_TORQUE_TIME` spin model (a substantially
  larger redesign than this requirement's own scope) — both left for a
  future requirement.
- 5 new `drive.rs` tests (two unit tests of the new functions, three
  integration tests confirming exact scaled magnitudes from a car
  already at `MAX_CAR_SPEED`). All pre-existing tests pass unchanged —
  every existing dodge test dodges from a standing start, where the new
  scale evaluates to `1.0` regardless of direction, an explicit
  zero-regression-risk property confirmed by inspection before
  implementation. 302 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+5 over FR-058's

## Real speed-dependent throttle taper
**2026-09-01** · [#123](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/123) · `b729cc8`

- **`THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`'s own doc comment had named this exact gap
  since it was introduced**: full flat acceleration right up to a hard
  cutoff at `UNBOOSTED_MAX_CAR_SPEED`, not a genuine taper — "a real
  simplification (not a taper)."
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `Car.cpp`** (not just `RLConst.h`'s
  constants this time) to find exactly how its own
  `THROTTLE_TORQUE_AMOUNT` is used, surfacing the real mechanism: drive
  force is scaled by `DRIVE_SPEED_TORQUE_FACTOR_CURVE`, a confirmed
  3-point piecewise-linear curve (`{0, 1.0}, {1400, 0.1}, {1410, 0.0}`),
  not applied flat.
- **`THROTTLE_TORQUE_AMOUNT` itself doesn't transfer cleanly** — it's
  expressed in Bullet-internal units calibrated against RocketSim's own
  car body, repeating `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s/`FR-057`'s own "false
  precision" finding — but the curve's *shape* is a pure, unitless ratio
  that does transfer, the same reasoning `FR-057` used to adopt
  `MAX_CAR_ANGULAR_SPEED`.
- **Added `drive::DRIVE_SPEED_TAPER_BREAKPOINTS`/`drive_speed_taper`**
  and replaced the hard cutoff with the real taper, evaluated against
  this port's own pre-existing signed, direction-aware speed (not
  RocketSim's own direction-agnostic `abs(forward speed)` — a separate
  behavioral question left out of scope).
- **`THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`'s own peak magnitude (`1600.0`) is
  unchanged**, still an uncalibrated placeholder — only the curve's real
  shape is now confirmed and modeled.
- 2 new `drive.rs` tests (a direct unit test of the interpolator at both
  breakpoints and both segment midpoints; a regression test confirming a
  car at 1400 uu/s now gains only ~10% of a full-strength step's
  velocity delta). All pre-existing tests pass unchanged. 297 total in
  `rb_physics_bullet` (+2 over FR-057's 295).

## Hard cap on car angular speed
**2026-09-01** · [#121](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/121) · `65c35e9`

- **Nothing previously bounded how fast sustained air control torque
  (or a dodge's own kick, or the landing-orientation assist) could spin
  a car** — holding full pitch/yaw/roll indefinitely spun a car
  arbitrarily fast, unlike real Rocket League.
- **Fetched RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` a second time** (the first fetch,
  for `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-056`, proved the technique could surface genuine
  findings), this time targeting every `drive.rs` constant this port's
  own doc comments flagged as having "no public reference at all"
  (`STEER_TORQUE`, `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`, `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`,
  `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED`, `DODGE_SPEED`, `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`,
  `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION`, `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION`,
  `LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`) — surfaced `CAR_MAX_ANG_SPEED = 5.5f`
  (rad/s), a hard "can never exceed" ceiling this port had no equivalent
  for.
- **Several other real constants the same fetch surfaced were considered
  and explicitly not adopted** (dodge per-direction impulse scaling,
  auto-flip thresholds, a ramping powerslide model, a steering-torque
  mapping, and RocketSim's own per-axis `CAR_AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`) — the
  torque-based ones repeat `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s own "false
  precision" finding (calibrated against RocketSim's own car
  mass/inertia tensor, which this port's placeholder body doesn't
  match), while `CAR_MAX_ANG_SPEED` bounds the *result* (a rad/s
  quantity) rather than the torque producing it, so it transfers
  cleanly regardless.
- **Added `drive::MAX_CAR_ANGULAR_SPEED`/`drive::clamp_angular_speed`**
  (a genuine clamp, unlike `MAX_CAR_SPEED`'s force-gating), wired in
  right after `integrate::integrate_velocities` in both `world.rs`'s
  production path and `drive.rs`'s own test helper.
- **Also noted, as a coincidence**: the pre-existing uncalibrated
  `drive::DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` placeholder is numerically equal to this
  same `5.5` value — flagged in both constants' own doc comments, not
  treated as a second confirmation.
- 3 new `drive.rs` tests (two unit tests for the clamp function, one
  proving sustained full roll input caps out rather than growing
  unbounded). All 292 pre-existing tests pass unchanged. 295 total in
  `rb_physics_bullet` (+3 over FR-056's 292).

## Boost acceleration ground/air split
**2026-09-01** · [#119](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/119) · `4eafed3`

- **Fetched RocketSim's own `RLConst.h` directly** and found this port's
  own single flat `drive::BOOST_ACCELERATION` constant collapsed two
  genuinely distinct reference values into one: `BOOST_ACCEL_GROUND =
  2975/3` (≈991.667, exactly matching this port's existing value) and a
  distinctly higher `BOOST_ACCEL_AIR = 3175/3` (≈1058.333, about 6.5%
  more).
- **This port's own doc comments had explicitly (and wrongly) claimed**
  boost "works identically airborne" — true for the *gating* (it always
  applies, unlike throttle/steering), false for the *magnitude*, which
  real Rocket League genuinely varies by ground contact.
- **Split into `BOOST_ACCELERATION_GROUND`/`BOOST_ACCELERATION_AIR`** and
  wired `apply_driven_forces`'s existing `on_ground` parameter to select
  between them — no new gating logic, only the applied magnitude changed.
  Every airborne boost this crate ever applied previously understated
  real airborne boost strength by about 6.5%.
- **Confirmed as a byproduct, not a new finding**: `BOOST_CONSUMPTION_RATE`/
  `MAX_BOOST` already match RocketSim's own `BOOST_USED_PER_SECOND =
  BOOST_MAX / 3` — no change needed there.
- 1 new `drive.rs` test confirming the exact ratio between grounded and
  airborne boost acceleration matches the reference's own ratio. All 291
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged. 292 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+1
  over FR-055's 291).

## `GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`/`GOAL_HEIGHT` reference confirmation
**2026-09-01** · [#117](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/117) · `fd53770`

- **Fetched the current RLBot wiki's "Useful Game Values" page directly**
  (the same page `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-036`'s own research already used to
  confirm `arena::GOAL_DEPTH`) and confirmed `arena::GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`
  (`892.755`) and `arena::GOAL_HEIGHT` (`642.775`) exact against its own
  cited "Goal center-to-post"/"Goal height" numbers — no value change, a
  sourcing-status upgrade from "commonly-cited, unconfirmed" to
  "confirmed", the same non-behavioral outcome `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-036`
  reached for `GOAL_DEPTH`/`CORNER_LENGTH`.
- **Found and fixed a stale spec passage**: this spec's own "Open
  questions" section still described `arena::GOAL_DEPTH` as an
  unconfirmed "uncalibrated invention" — directly contradicting
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-036`'s own already-shipped Requirements entry and
  this spec's own Non-goals section, both of which already say it's
  confirmed. Never updated when FR-036 shipped; rewritten to state all
  three goal-geometry constants (`GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`, `GOAL_HEIGHT`,
  `GOAL_DEPTH`) are now confirmed, leaving only `arena::NET_DEPTH` open
  in that vicinity.
- No new tests — a pure constant-sourcing/doc correction with no
  behavioral change, matching `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`/`FR-036`'s own
  precedent. All 291 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

## Goal-wall/bounded-wall corner-testing overlap investigation
**2026-09-01** · [#115](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/115) · `bf8e713`

- **Closed the one question `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-028`'s own doc comment
  left open**: could `collision::box_vs_goal_wall`'s per-corner window
  test under-detect a car's face resting flush against the window's own
  edge, every corner just clear of it while the face's middle already
  overlapped it — the same category of concern `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-032`
  investigated for a curved fillet, but explicitly not covered by that
  finding since a goal window's boundary is a flat rectangle, not a
  curve.
- **Resolved via a convex-hull argument**: a box's touching face is the
  convex hull of whichever corners individually penetrate the plane, so
  "every corner outside the (convex) window" is exactly equivalent to
  "the face doesn't fully fit through it" — the correct condition for
  treating it as blocked. No bug, matching `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-032`'s own
  "further investigation found the suspected gap doesn't exist"
  precedent, via a distinct argument (convex containment, not a convex
  scalar maximum).
- **Investigated `collision::box_vs_bounded_wall` alongside it**, since it
  shares the identical corner-testing technique with the opposite gate,
  and found the mirror image *is* a genuine gap: a face larger than a
  bound and centered on it has no corner touching solid material even
  though the bound's own rectangle sits entirely within the face's
  interior, so it reports zero contacts despite genuinely resting on real
  material.
- **Confirmed this gap is currently unreachable**: this project's own
  two `StaticBoundedWall`s (`arena::goal_side_wall`/`goal_roof`, hundreds
  of units on their shortest side) are always far larger than this
  project's own established car (`60x30x18` half-extents) or ball
  (`93.15` radius) — documented as an explicit Non-goals item rather than
  fixed with a heavier 2D convex-polygon overlap test no constructible
  scene needs.
- 2 new `collision.rs` tests. All 289 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
  291 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+2 over `FR-053`'s 289).

## `combine_friction` defensive clamp
**2026-09-01** · [#113](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/113) · `310f588`

- **`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043` fetched and read real Bullet's own
  `btManifoldResult::calculateCombinedFriction`/`calculateCombinedRestitution`
  source** to correct this spec's wrong claim about the reference's
  default combine mode, but never separately examined one more detail
  visible in that same source: real Bullet's own `calculateCombinedFriction`
  additionally clamps its product result to `[-10.0, 10.0]`
  (`calculateCombinedRestitution` has no such clamp).
- **Re-fetched and re-read `btManifoldResult.cpp` directly** to confirm
  the clamp's exact mechanics (a plain `if` clamp, not `btClamped`,
  applied only to friction).
- **Confirmed the clamp is currently inert for this crate's own actual
  material-property values** — every `RigidBody`/`StaticPlane`/
  `StaticQuarterPipe`/`StaticCornerFillet`/`StaticGoalWall`/
  `StaticBoundedWall` this crate itself ever constructs uses a friction
  coefficient in `0.1..=0.9`, nowhere near either bound.
- **Adopted the clamp anyway, for reference conformance against a
  genuinely unvalidated boundary**: every one of those types' own
  `friction` field is a public, unvalidated `f32`, so a future caller (or
  a bug elsewhere) setting an extreme or negative value would hit
  `combine_friction` with no defense today, unlike real Bullet.
  `solver::combine_friction` now clamps its own average result to
  `[-10.0, 10.0]`, keeping the average formula
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-043` already decided to keep — this only adds the
  clamp, not a formula change. `combine_restitution` is left unclamped,
  matching the reference's own choice not to clamp restitution either.
- **1 new test.** All 288 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 289 total.

## Static-vs-dynamic combined-solve ordering investigation
**2026-09-01** · [#111](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/111) · `524b593`

- **`PhysicsWorld::step` resolved a body's now-combined static contacts and
  its combined dynamic manifolds as two separate solves** — one fully
  resolved and applied before the other's own setup for that same body
  ever read the result — the same independent-pairwise gap
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`/`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050`/`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-051`
  already proved under-converges, just at the boundary between the two
  existing combined solves instead of inside either one.
- **A dedicated single-shot test confirmed the mechanism is genuinely
  order-dependent, not merely slow to converge.** Reusing
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-051`'s own symmetric two-wall corner setup, with one
  wall replaced by a very-heavy dynamic body (`mass = 1e9`, geometrically
  identical contact) routed through the dynamic-manifold code path instead
  of the static one: resolving the static wall fully first, then the
  dynamic body (`step`'s own pre-fix order), left the ball biased toward
  whichever channel was resolved last; the reversed order gave the exact
  mirror image.
- **A new `solver::resolve_manifolds` folds a step's static and dynamic
  manifolds into one shared solve**, sharing one `DeltaVelocity`/push-delta
  accumulator per body index across both channels for the whole
  `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` loop. `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-041`'s own `1 / k`
  relaxation keeps counting `k` purely from dynamic manifolds — extending
  it to a body's static rows was tried and found to *regress*
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-051`'s own two-static-wall test's convergence, so it
  wasn't adopted.
- **`PhysicsWorld::step` was rewired to use it**: `resolve_static_contacts`
  became `static_contact_manifolds` (now returning gathered manifolds
  instead of resolving them directly), and `step` makes one
  `solver::resolve_manifolds` call instead of two separate ones.
- **A `PhysicsWorld::step`-level test proves the fix at the real public
  API**: a ball fired diagonally into a real wall-and-heavy-car corner
  settles with nearly equal x/y velocity components after one real `step`
  call — confirmed to fail under the old two-call sequence before the
  rewire.
- **2 new tests.** All 286 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 288 total.

## Static multi-surface contact combined-solve investigation
**2026-09-01** · [#109](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/109) · `6581c7f`

- **`PhysicsWorld::step` resolved a body's contact against each static
  shape type independently and sequentially** — the ground, then every
  wall, then every curve, then every corner fillet, then every goal wall,
  then every bounded wall, one independent `solver::resolve_contacts` call
  per shape — the exact independent-pairwise shape `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`/
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-050` already proved under-converges (and can be
  genuinely order-dependent) for a shared body touched by 2+ others in the
  same step. This port's own module doc comment had claimed resolving each
  independently was safe "since a body's contact with static geometry
  never depends on another dynamic body" — true, but silent on a body
  touching two different *static* surfaces at once.
- **A dedicated single-shot test confirmed the mechanism is genuinely
  order-dependent, not merely slow to converge.** A ball wedged
  symmetrically into a corner formed by two static walls (perpendicular
  normals, identical restitution/friction), moving diagonally into both at
  once: resolving each wall fully independently in one order left the ball
  biased toward whichever wall was resolved last; the opposite order gave
  the exact mirror image.
- **A new `solver::resolve_static_manifolds` generalizes `resolve_contacts`
  to combine every static-shape manifold a body touches into one shared
  solve**, sharing one accumulator across every group for the whole
  `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` loop — the same fix `resolve_dynamic_manifolds`
  (`FR-030`) and `net::NetMesh::step` (`FR-050`) already made for their own
  independent-pairwise gaps.
- **`PhysicsWorld::step` was rewired to use it**: a new
  `resolve_static_contacts` (bundling the six static-shape slices into a
  `StaticScene` to stay under clippy's argument-count limit) gathers every
  one of a body's contacts across every static shape into one manifold
  list, resolving them all together — replacing the old
  five-function-per-body call sequence
  (`resolve_plane_contact`/`resolve_curve_contact`/
  `resolve_corner_fillet_contact`/`resolve_goal_wall_contact`/
  `resolve_bounded_wall_contact`, all removed).
- **A `PhysicsWorld::step`-level test proves the fix at the real public
  API**: a ball fired diagonally into a symmetric two-wall corner via an
  actual `PhysicsWorld` settles with nearly equal x/y velocity components
  after one real `step` call — confirmed to fail under the old sequential
  per-shape loop before the rewire.
- **2 new tests.** All 284 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 286 total.

## Net-point contact combined-solve investigation
**2026-09-01** · [#107](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/107) · `4d1a4b8`

- **`net::NetMesh::step` resolved every body-vs-net-point contact
  independently and sequentially**, one pair at a time via
  `solver::resolve_contacts_between` — the exact independent-pairwise shape
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030` already proved under-converges (and can be
  genuinely order-dependent) for a shared body touched by 2+ others in the
  same step. This module's own doc comment had waved that off as
  irrelevant here, reasoning a net point's own mass is "tiny enough" to
  not matter.
- **That "tiny enough" claim was checked and found false.** `NET_POINT_MASS`
  (`0.5`) is exactly half a typical ball's own mass (`1.0`) — not a
  lopsided ratio. A ball or car pressing into the net commonly overlaps
  two or more free points at once, given `NET_POINT_RADIUS`'s own generous
  coverage-radius sizing.
- **A dedicated single-shot test confirmed the mechanism is genuinely
  order-dependent, not merely slow to converge.** For a ball placed
  exactly symmetrically between two net-point-like bodies, resolving each
  point fully independently in one order left the ball with a nonzero
  sideways velocity; the opposite order left the mirror-image velocity —
  a purely arbitrary artifact of iteration order.
- **A `NetMesh::step`-level test measured the real-world size of the bias
  directly**: a ball fired squarely at the net's own center, straddling
  two symmetric free interior points, was measurably deflected sideways by
  ~0.25 units/s out of a 2000 units/s impact under the old sequential
  loop.
- **Adopted `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds`'s combined solve** for
  every body-vs-point contact detected within a sub-step, instead of
  resolving each pair immediately and independently. Measured directly:
  reduces the squarely-centered-impact residual from ~0.25 units/s to
  ~0.016 units/s, roughly a 15-fold improvement. Warm-starting is
  deliberately not part of this fix, left as the same kind of open
  follow-up work `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-035` already scoped out for
  `resolve_contacts`/`resolve_contacts_between` generally.
- **2 new tests.** All 282 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 284 total.

## Velocity-aligned friction direction selection
**2026-09-01** · [#105](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/105) · `1954adf`

- **Closes the genuine, significant divergence `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-048`
  found and explicitly left open**: this port's `setup_rows` and
  `setup_two_body_rows` always derived both friction directions from a
  fixed, velocity-independent `plane_space(&contact.normal)` basis, where
  real Bullet's actual default aligns friction direction 1 with the
  tangential component of the current relative sliding velocity.
- **A new `friction_directions` helper implements real Bullet's actual
  default.** Direction 1 becomes the normalized tangential component of
  relative velocity (`relative_velocity - normal * rel_vel`) whenever it's
  non-negligible and normalizable; direction 2 completes a right-handed
  orthonormal basis via `dir1.cross(normal)`. Falls back to
  `plane_space`'s fixed basis when tangential velocity is negligible,
  matching real Bullet's own `SIMD_EPSILON` threshold.
- **A second, genuinely new fallback case was found and fixed: near-
  head-on catastrophic cancellation.** When relative velocity is almost
  entirely along the normal, subtracting two nearly-equal-magnitude
  vectors can leave a degenerate residual whose direction is dominated by
  rounding error rather than the true (near-zero) tangential velocity —
  occasionally landing close enough to `normal` that `dir1.cross(normal)`
  fails to normalize. Real Bullet's own unguarded `normalize()` would
  silently mishandle this; this crate's own `Option`-returning
  `Vec3::normalize()` instead falls back to `plane_space` gracefully.
  Found empirically via a real panic surfaced by the full test suite.
- **Both one-body and two-body contact setup were updated** (`setup_rows`
  and `setup_two_body_rows`), each hoisting its own relative-velocity
  computation into a shared local reused by `friction_directions`.
- **A dedicated isotropic-friction regression test proves the fix has
  real bite**: verified to fail when `friction_directions` is reverted to
  unconditionally call `plane_space`, confirming this isn't a test that
  trivially passes regardless of the fix.
- **3 new tests.** All 279 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 282 total.

## `solver.rs` constraint-row setup/resolve reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [#103](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/103) · `69c07b9`

- **Fetched and read Bullet's real
  `btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver.cpp`/`.h`, `btContactSolverInfo.h`,
  and `btVector3.h` directly** to check every Bullet-reference claim
  `restitution_curve`, `plane_space`, `setup_rows`, and `resolve_row`
  make.
- **`plane_space` confirmed byte-for-byte exact** against real
  `btPlaneSpace1`.
- **`restitution_curve` confirmed behaviorally exact.** Real
  `restitutionCurve` can return a raw negative value; its one caller
  clamps a non-positive result to `0.` immediately afterward. This
  function's own `.max(0.0)` folds that call-site clamp inline — a
  confirmed equivalent restructuring, not a divergence.
- **`setup_rows` confirmed exact** against real
  `setupContactConstraint`/`setupFrictionConstraint`, correcting a stale
  doc-comment citation to a differently-named, unrelated function.
- **`resolve_row` confirmed a behaviorally-equivalent unification** of
  Bullet's own two separate resolver functions (one lower-bound-only, one
  two-bound), given the normal row's effectively-infinite upper limit.
- **All 6 of `btContactSolverInfo`'s cited default constants confirmed
  exact.**
- **One genuine, significant divergence found, not adopted.** This port
  always derives both friction directions from a fixed,
  velocity-independent basis (`plane_space(&contact.normal)`). Real
  Bullet's actual default instead aligns friction direction 1 with the
  tangential component of the current relative sliding velocity itself,
  falling back to the fixed basis only when that velocity is negligible.
  A fixed two-axis friction limit can over/under-estimate the true
  circular friction cone by up to `sqrt(2)` relative to the real slide
  direction — a physically meaningful difference, flagged as open
  follow-up work for a dedicated future FR (the same scoping already used
  for FR-030/FR-034/FR-035/FR-037) rather than folded into this
  reference-validation pass.
- **1 new regression test** pins the `restitution_curve`/call-site-clamp
  equivalence directly. All 278 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 279
  total.

## `collision.rs` remaining closed-form shape pairings reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [#101](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/101) · `ed8c59e`

- **Fetched and read Bullet's real `btConvexPlaneCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`/
  `.h`, `btSphereBoxCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`,
  `btSphereSphereCollisionAlgorithm.cpp`, and `btManifoldPoint.h`
  directly** to check every Bullet-reference claim `sphere_vs_plane`,
  `box_vs_plane`, `sphere_vs_box`, and `sphere_vs_sphere` make —
  `box_vs_box` was already checked this way (FR-042); this closes out the
  rest of `collision.rs`.
- **`sphere_vs_plane` and `sphere_vs_sphere` confirmed exact.**
- **`sphere_vs_box`'s deep-penetration face selection confirmed to
  reproduce Bullet's own exact tie-break order**, not just a
  mathematically-equivalent alternative: real Bullet checks
  `+x, -x, +y, -y, +z, -z` in that fixed order, only overriding on a
  strictly smaller distance, so an exact tie always resolves to whichever
  face is checked earliest — worked through by hand on a deliberately
  non-symmetric tied case and confirmed to match.
- **One genuine, deliberate divergence found in `box_vs_plane`, not
  adopted.** Real Bullet's default configuration generates only one
  contact point per frame via a single GJK support query, relying on
  several frames of persistent-manifold accumulation to reach a resting
  box's full 4-corner manifold. This port's `box_vs_plane` computes all 4
  corners exactly in one pass — confirmed a favorable divergence in the
  same spirit as `box_vs_box`'s own FR-042 finding, not adopted.
- **1 new regression test** pins the exact tie-break-order match
  directly. All 277 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 278 total.

## `body.rs`/`mat3.rs` reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [#99](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/99) · `4d3de85`

- **Fetched and read Bullet's real `btSphereShape.cpp`, `btBoxShape.cpp`,
  `btRigidBody.cpp`/`.h`, and `btMatrix3x3.h` directly** to check every
  Bullet-reference claim `body.rs`'s `Shape::local_inertia`/
  `RigidBody::update_inertia_tensor` and `mat3.rs`'s
  `Mat3::scaled_columns`/`Mat3::from_quat` make — the same rigor already
  applied to `collision.rs` (FR-042), `solver.rs` (FR-043), and
  `integrate.rs` (FR-045).
- **Sphere/box local-inertia formulas, `update_inertia_tensor`, and
  `Mat3::scaled_columns` all confirmed byte-for-byte accurate.**
- **One genuine difference found, not adopted.** `Mat3::from_quat`
  hardcodes an `s = 2` factor assuming an exactly unit-length input
  quaternion; the reference's own `btMatrix3x3::setRotation` computes
  `s = 2 / q.length2()` to self-correct for a non-unit-length input.
  Confirmed empirically that a scaled, non-unit quaternion produces a
  non-orthonormal matrix through this function, unlike Bullet's own
  self-correcting version. Not adopted: this function's only production
  call site always receives an already-renormalized orientation (per
  FR-045's own finding), making the reference's self-correction
  unreachable defensive theater here.
- **1 new regression test** pins this exact distinction directly. All
  276 pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 277 total.

## `integrate.rs` reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [PR #97](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/97) · `cbd9918`

- **Fetched and read Bullet's real `btRigidBody.cpp`/`.h`,
  `btTransformUtil.h`, `btQuaternion.h`, and `btScalar.h` directly** to
  check every Bullet-reference claim `integrate.rs`'s own doc comments
  make — the same rigor already applied to `collision.rs` (FR-042) and
  `solver.rs` (FR-043).
- **`apply_damping`, `integrate_velocities`, and `integrate_transform` all
  confirmed byte-for-byte accurate.** `BT_USE_OLD_DAMPING_METHOD` is never
  defined anywhere in the reference, so the pow-based damping branch is
  genuinely Bullet's real default; `MAX_ANGVEL`'s value and clamp formula
  match exactly; `integrate_transform`'s exponential-map math
  (`ANGULAR_MOTION_THRESHOLD`, the small-angle Taylor coefficient, the
  sinc-based rotation-axis formula) all match exactly too.
- **One minor numeric difference found, not adopted.** This port's own
  degenerate-quaternion guard uses `1e-12`; the reference's own
  `SIMD_EPSILON` is `FLT_EPSILON` — roughly `1.19e-7` for `f32`, about 5
  orders of magnitude larger. Both are far below any physically realistic
  quaternion magnitude, so the two are behaviorally indistinguishable for
  every reachable scenario — kept as-is.
- **A more significant finding: the fallback branch is load-bearing, not
  defensive theater.** This function's check-then-normalize guard exists
  specifically to match Bullet's own real fallback choice — preserve the
  body's prior orientation on a degenerate result, never reset to
  identity. An unconditional call to `Quat::normalize` would have
  silently gotten this wrong, since that function's own generic guard
  substitutes `IDENTITY` instead — a real, observable divergence from
  Bullet's actual reference behavior.
- **1 new regression test** pins this exact distinction directly. All 275
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 276 total.

## Stale "split impulse" Non-goals correction
**2026-08-31** · [PR #95](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/95) · `45cb184`

- This project's own spec still carried a "Split impulse. This port always
  takes Bullet's non-split contact-resolution branch" Non-goals bullet —
  contradicted by `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-034`'s own already-shipped
  implementation from earlier in this project. FR-034's own Requirements
  entry, the version 0.34.0 Change History entry, and
  `rb_physics_bullet::solver`'s own module doc comment all already
  correctly described split impulse as implemented; only this one
  Non-goals bullet had never been updated to match.
- Confirmed the implementation is genuinely present (not just documented
  elsewhere) by locating `solver::resolve_push_row`/
  `resolve_two_body_push_row`/`apply_push_delta` directly in `solver.rs`,
  and confirmed via a repo-wide search that this was the only stale
  occurrence anywhere in code or docs.
- Corrected the bullet to a strikethrough-and-close note, matching the
  same convention this spec's own Non-goals section already uses for two
  other resolved items.
- Zero production code changed. No new tests (documentation-only, no
  value or behavior changed); all 275 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

## Restitution/friction combine-mode reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [PR #93](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/93) · `aa9938d`

- **This project's own spec claimed, without ever having checked, that
  Bullet's default restitution/friction combine mode is `max` for both.**
  Fetched and read `btManifoldResult.h`/`btManifoldResult.cpp` in full and
  found that claim wrong.
- **Bullet's real default for both is an unclamped product (`a * b`)** —
  friction's own version additionally clamps the result to `[-10, 10]` —
  with no `max` mode, no geometric mean, and no per-pair override anywhere
  in the reference short of a custom `gContactAddedCallback`.
- **This port's own average combine mode is kept anyway, now for a correct
  reason.** Average preserves the identity `combine(a, a) == a` (two
  surfaces sharing a coefficient combine back to that coefficient), which
  the reference's own product does not (`0.5 * 0.5 == 0.25`) — and most
  bodies in this port currently share the same uncalibrated placeholder
  `0.5` for both coefficients, so the reference's real default would
  silently combine the overwhelming majority of this port's own contacts
  to `0.25`, a value nobody chose.
- **Whether either formula matches real Rocket League itself is
  unaffected by this correction** and remains genuinely open, needing real
  recorded ball/ground behavior to calibrate against — only the wrong
  reference-fact claim, and this port's own justification for diverging
  from the *correct* one, changed.
- **2 new dedicated unit tests** pin `combine_restitution`/
  `combine_friction`'s own identity-preserving behavior directly. All 273
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged; 275 total.

## Box-vs-box reference validation
**2026-08-31** · [PR #91](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/91) · `feabc32`

- **Fetched and read Bullet's own `btBoxBoxDetector::dBoxBox` reference
  source directly** to validate two "reasonable, tested choices, never
  validated against the reference" this project's own spec flagged as open.
- **Edge-edge contact point: confirmed more rigorous than the reference.**
  `dBoxBox`'s own contact point uses `dLineClosestApproach` — closest
  approach between two *infinite lines*, applied with no clamping to the
  finite edge length at all (confirmed directly in the fetched source).
  This port's own finite-segment closest-point construction (Ericson's
  algorithm) correctly stays within both edges — a genuine improvement
  over the reference it's ported from, not merely an equivalent
  restatement of it.
- **Face-clipping degenerate fallback: confirmed a deliberate, favorable
  divergence.** The reference contains the exact same undocumented
  "should never happen" judgment call (twice, zero justification given
  either time) this port's own code comment already made. Where the two
  diverge is policy: the reference's own fallback drops the collision
  entirely, while this port synthesizes a contact instead, since SAT has
  already confirmed real overlap by that point and dropping it risks a
  body tunneling through in a rare grazing case.
- **Investigated a candidate fix for the edge-edge sign-selection
  heuristic — found genuinely mixed, not adopted.** Which of a box's 4
  candidate parallel edges is "near" is picked via a heuristic either way;
  swapping this port's center-to-center-vector proxy for the reference's
  own SAT-normal-based one was built and empirically tested against a
  brute-force ground truth across 50,000 randomized configurations: the
  current heuristic wins for large/arbitrary penetration depths (~11.6%
  vs. ~8.7% optimal-match rate), the candidate wins for realistic
  near-first-contact depths (~93% vs. ~77%), and neither is reliably
  optimal. Kept as-is.
- **No new tests** — documentation-only, no value or behavior changed,
  the same precedent FR-032/FR-040 established for a rigorously
  investigated negative result being real, valuable work. All 273
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

## Sandwiched-solve convergence
**2026-08-31** · [PR #89](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/89) · `4b0a133`

- **Investigated whether anything short of real recorded data could narrow
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`'s own documented extreme-mass-ratio "sandwiched"
  under-convergence gap** at this crate's fixed `SOLVER_ITERATIONS = 10`.
- **Tried a naive global SOR-style relaxation factor first — and rejected
  it**: factors above 1.0 (over-relaxation) made FR-030's own
  symmetric-pinch test scenario measurably *diverge* (worse than the
  pre-FR-030 independent-pairwise approach), while factors below 1.0
  (under-relaxation) made it monotonically *better*, matching standard
  PGS/SOR theory for a tightly-coupled multi-constraint body.
- **`solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` now scales each manifold's
  velocity-row impulse by a parameter-free `1 / k`** instead, where `k` is
  the number of manifolds sharing a body this step — the same "fair share"
  weighting position-based-dynamics solvers use for a point mass under
  several simultaneous constraints. Mathematically dominant rather than a
  tuned magic number: it can only reduce, never increase, a shared body's
  per-iteration overshoot, so it needed no real recorded data to justify
  adopting.
- **Narrows FR-030's own symmetric-pinch result from ~89.5 to ~32 units/s**
  (independent-pairwise stays ~98.9), at zero added iteration cost. A body
  touched by only one other body this step (`k == 1`, the overwhelming
  majority of contacts) is a mathematical no-op, confirmed by a dedicated
  bit-for-bit-equivalence test against `resolve_contacts_between`.
- **Does not achieve full convergence** to the true simultaneous-solve
  answer within one call's fixed `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` — the gap is
  narrowed, not closed; real recorded multi-car contact data would still
  be needed to know whether the residual error matters for fidelity in
  practice.
- **2 new tests**; all 271 pre-existing tests pass unchanged. 273 total in
  `rb_physics_bullet` (+2 over FR-040's 271).

## Fillet-radius calibration research
**2026-08-31** · [PR #87](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/87) · `f92ceed`

- **A dedicated research pass looked for a real reference for
  `arena::FILLET_RADIUS`/`CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS`** — the two uncalibrated
  placeholder constants FR-036's own constant-ambiguity research left
  untouched — searching this port's established reference tier
  (RocketSim/RLUtilities source, the RLBot wiki, RLGym's game values).
- **Found exactly one candidate, and deliberately didn't adopt it**: the
  RLBot wiki's uncited "wall bottom ramp radius: approx. 256, not
  circular". It carries no citation, doesn't distinguish `FILLET_RADIUS`
  from the corner walls' own distinctly bigger `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS`,
  explicitly disclaims being a true circular arc, and shares its numeral
  with RLGym's own unrelated `RAMP_HEIGHT` (a ramp's height from the
  ground, not a curve's radius) — suggesting the wiki entry may conflate
  the two rather than independently measure a radius.
- **Both constants remain unchanged (`292.0`/`750.0`) and genuinely
  uncalibrated.** Adopting an unreliable number would trade one honestly
  uncalibrated placeholder for a differently-uncertain one dressed up as a
  citation — a worse outcome than leaving it alone.
- **Genuinely closing this needs actual extracted collision-mesh geometry**
  (e.g. via `ZealanL/RLArenaCollisionDumper`'s real triangle-mesh dump),
  which needs the owner's own Windows/Rocket League environment — the same
  blocker `RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001` already documents.
- **No new tests** — documentation-only, no runtime value changed, matching
  FR-031/FR-036's own precedent for constant-audit findings that don't
  change a value. All 271 pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

## Car-vs-net contact
**2026-08-31** · [PR #85](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/85) · `fdbd940`

- **A car is now caught by a goal net too, not just the ball** — closes
  this port's own former Non-goal that "a car still passes straight
  through a `net::NetMesh`'s spatial footprint untouched."
- **`net::NetMesh::step` changed from a single `&mut RigidBody` (the ball
  alone) to `&mut [RigidBody]`** (every body that can touch the net). Its
  inner contact-resolution loop now iterates every body in the slice
  against each free point. A single-element slice for the ball alone
  behaves identically to the old signature — every one of this module's
  pre-existing tests only needed a call-syntax update
  (`std::slice::from_mut(&mut ball)`), not a changed assertion.
- **No new collision code was needed** — `collision::contacts_between`
  already dispatches to `sphere_vs_box` for a car (box) against a net
  point (sphere) the same way it always has for ball-vs-car.
- **`PhysicsWorld::step` reuses the same ball-plus-cars snapshot**
  `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` already resolved that step for the
  net-step call too, deferring the sync back to `self.ball`/`self.cars`
  until after every net has had its turn, instead of syncing immediately
  and rebuilding a second snapshot just for the net loop.
- **3 new tests**: 2 in `net.rs` (the direct car analog of the existing
  "caught vs. free flight" ball test, and a test proving both a ball and a
  car are resolved against the same net step, not just the first body in
  the slice) and 1 in `world.rs` (the live-`PhysicsWorld` end-to-end
  proof, mirroring the ball's own version).
- 3 new tests, 271 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+3 over FR-039's 268). All
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.

## Wall-jump corner disambiguation
**2026-08-31** · [PR #86](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/86) · `99234c6`

- **A wall jump at a corner now pushes off diagonally, blending both
  touched walls**, instead of firing along only one of them depending on
  iteration order. `PhysicsWorld::step`'s per-car wall-normal computation
  sums every wall a car is touching this step and normalizes the result,
  instead of `Iterator::find`-ing the first match.
- **Closes a simplification documented since FR-013**, made reachable in
  the standard arena for the first time by FR-019's diagonal corner walls
  (a car can now genuinely touch two walls at once at a real corner).
- **A car touching exactly one wall is bit-for-bit unaffected** — summing
  a single unit-length wall normal and normalizing it is a no-op, so every
  pre-existing wall-jump test passes unchanged.
- **No new collision code was needed** — `resolve_plane_contact` already
  resolved simultaneous multi-wall contact correctly; only the wall-jump
  push-off direction picker, `drive::apply_driven_forces`'s own input, was
  affected.
- **1 new test**, `a_car_touching_two_walls_at_a_corner_wall_jumps_diagonally_outward`
  (two perpendicular walls, a car touching both at once, asserting the
  push-off comes out diagonal with equal horizontal components). 268 total
  in `rb_physics_bullet` (+1 over FR-037's 267).

## Sleeping
**2026-08-31** · [PR #83](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/83) · `33c4b77`

- **A body's velocity now forcibly zeroes once it's stayed below a linear
  and an angular threshold for a sustained time**, closing the "no
  sleeping" half of the solver's own documented gap warm-starting left
  open. New `body::RigidBody::update_sleep_state`/`wake`.
- **This is the actual fix for a bouncy resting contact never settling** —
  the limitation neither split impulse nor warm-starting alone could
  close, since restitution re-triggers off a fresh gravity-induced closing
  velocity every frame regardless of where the solver's iteration starts
  or how it got there.
- **A car wakes unconditionally the instant it receives genuinely active
  input**, before that input's own force has had a chance to move it — a
  resultant-velocity-only wake check isn't enough, since a driving force
  whose one-frame delta is itself smaller than the sleep threshold would
  otherwise get zeroed right back out every frame, permanently stranding
  an asleep car. A new `input_is_active` helper treats an unrecovered
  analog channel (`None`) the same as a recovered-but-literally-neutral
  one (`Some(0.0)`), so a car fed a real recorded input stream that always
  resolves every channel doesn't get stuck permanently awake either.
- **All three new threshold constants are uncalibrated placeholders** —
  no public reference exists for what, if any, real Rocket League's own
  physics engine uses internally for this purely implementation-internal
  stabilization detail.
- **8 new tests** (5 in `body.rs` exercising the mechanism directly, 3 in
  `world.rs` proving it through a live `PhysicsWorld`, including a direct
  demonstration that a nonzero-restitution resting ball now actually falls
  asleep at exactly zero velocity instead of bouncing forever). All
  pre-existing tests pass unchanged.
- 8 new tests, 267 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+8 over FR-036's 259).

## Ball radius and ceiling height corrections
**2026-08-31** · [PR #81](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/81) · `ab892bf`

- **Resolved both constant ambiguities `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s own audit
  surfaced but deliberately didn't act on**, using real source-level
  research (cloning and reading RocketSim's and RLUtilities' own source,
  and the current RLBot wiki, rather than guessing from prior training-data
  recall).
- **Ball radius: `92.75` became `93.15`, not the previously-suspected
  `91.25`.** FR-031 had framed this as a straight two-way choice, but the
  real games actually split the ball into a smaller inertia radius
  (`91.25`) and a distinctly larger collision radius (`93.15`, the mesh's
  own collision margin) — a split this port's single unified
  `RigidBody::sphere` radius field has no room for. Since this port has no
  separate Bullet-style collision margin of its own, the collision radius
  is the mathematically correct single-constant analog, so switching to
  `91.25` would have been a regression, not a fix. Every `92.75` literal
  across `solver.rs`/`world.rs`/`net.rs`/`collision.rs` became `93.15`.
- **`arena::CEILING_Z`: `2044.0` became `2048.0`.** Confirmed, via both
  RocketSim's own `ARENA_HEIGHT = 2048.f` and an independent reconstruction
  from real extracted collision-mesh geometry, to describe the same
  reference point this port's `CEILING_Z` does.
- **Two mis-documented claims corrected as a low-risk byproduct**, not new
  findings requiring their own change: `arena::CORNER_LENGTH` and
  `arena::GOAL_DEPTH` were wrongly described (by earlier FRs) as
  uncalibrated placeholders with no public reference — both are actually
  confirmed exact, so only their doc comments changed, not their values.
- **`arena::FILLET_RADIUS`/`CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` remain untouched and still
  genuinely uncalibrated.** No analytic single-number reference exists for
  either in the serious community sources — closing that gap for real
  would mean ingesting an actual dumped collision mesh, a separate,
  more involved follow-up deliberately left for later.
- **No new tests** — a constant-only correction with no new behavior to
  characterize, the same precedent `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031` established for
  its own constant changes. All 259 pre-existing tests across the crate
  pass unchanged (total unchanged from the warm-starting change).

## Warm-starting
**2026-08-31** · [PR #79](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/79) · `a79d923`

- **`solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds` (every ball-vs-car/car-vs-car
  manifold) now warm-starts from the previous call's converged impulses**
  instead of zero. A new `solver::ContactCache` carries a manifold's
  converged real-channel impulses (normal plus both friction rows) from
  one call to the next, matched by each contact's approximate world
  position.
- **The seed is applied to the running velocity delta, not just bookkeeping.**
  Merely setting a row's `applied_impulse` to a cached value would do
  nothing on its own here — this port's `GLOBAL_CFM` is always `0.0`, so
  that field never otherwise enters the per-iteration math. A new
  `warm_start_two_body_row` instead pre-loads the cached impulse's effect
  directly into the manifold's shared `DeltaVelocity` accumulators before
  any iteration runs, mirroring Bullet's own warm-start (applying the
  cached impulse to the solver body's temporary velocity at setup time).
- **`resolve_dynamic_manifolds` gained a `caches` parameter** — one
  `ContactCache` per (normalized) body-index pair. Every call rebuilds it
  from only that call's own manifolds, so a pair no longer touching drops
  out automatically, no separate eviction pass needed. `PhysicsWorld`
  gains one persistent `dynamic_manifold_caches` field, passed into its
  one `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` call site.
- **Deliberately scoped to this one call site.** `resolve_contacts`/
  `resolve_contacts_between` (every static-geometry contact, for both the
  ball and every car) stay un-warm-started: this port's fixed
  `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` already fully converges every one-body/two-body
  scenario this crate tests, so warm-starting them has no scenario to
  demonstrate value against yet. `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` already had
  one — `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`'s own documented extreme-mass-ratio
  "sandwiched" case, which doesn't fully converge within one call's
  iteration budget.
- **1 new `solver.rs` test** reuses that exact sandwiched-ball scenario:
  call 1 (cold) partially converges and populates a cache; from that
  identical post-call-1 state, call 2 then runs twice on independent
  copies — once warm (reusing call 1's cache), once cold (a fresh map) —
  with identical positions, contacts, velocities, and iteration budget
  both times, isolating exactly what the warm seed contributes. The warm
  run lands measurably closer to the true zero-velocity equilibrium than
  the cold repeat.
- **Does not fix the "bouncy resting contact never settles" limitation.**
  That symptom comes from restitution re-triggering off a fresh
  gravity-induced closing velocity every frame, independent of where the
  solver's iteration starts — warm-starting converges the same
  wrong-looking bounce faster, it doesn't stop it from recurring. Sleeping
  (still unimplemented) is the actual fix, and remains the sole open item
  under this port's old combined "no-warm-starting-or-sleeping" gap, which
  this change splits.
- All 14 of `solver.rs`'s pre-existing tests pass unchanged when given an
  empty cache, confirming this change is behavior-preserving for every
  case they already covered.
- 1 new test, 259 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+1 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-034`'s 258).

## Split impulse
**2026-08-31** · [PR #77](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/77) · `dedfeec`

- **Deep penetration correction no longer injects spurious velocity into a
  contact.** Every contact's normal row now also solves a second, entirely
  separate "push" pseudo-velocity channel
  (`solver::resolve_push_row`/`resolve_two_body_push_row`), fed only by
  that contact's own positional (penetration/ERP) error — never its
  velocity/restitution error, which stays on the real channel exactly as
  before. This is Bullet's own default (`m_splitImpulse = true`),
  documented as a deliberate gap in this port since the solver was first
  written.
- **Correction now moves position, not velocity.** After a manifold's
  iterations finish, the real velocity delta is applied to the body
  exactly as before, and the new push delta is applied directly to the
  body's position/orientation via a new `solver::apply_push_delta` (built
  on the existing `integrate::integrate_transform`, no new integration
  math) — mirroring Bullet's own `btSolverBody::writebackVelocity`, which
  performs the identical second, independent `integrateTransform` call
  using the push velocity right after writing back the real velocity
  delta.
- **Wired into every resolve path with zero call-site changes elsewhere.**
  `resolve_contacts`, `resolve_contacts_between`, and
  `resolve_dynamic_manifolds` each gained the push-channel resolve/apply
  calls; `world.rs`, `net.rs`, and every other caller of these three
  functions is unaffected.
- **2 new `solver.rs` tests** directly prove the core claim: a
  deeply-penetrating, at-rest contact (zero restitution, zero incoming
  velocity) leaves the real post-solve velocity along the contact normal
  near zero, while the body/bodies' positions measurably separate to
  relieve the overlap — for both the one-body (`resolve_contacts`) and
  two-body (`resolve_contacts_between`) paths.
- **4 pre-existing `world.rs` live end-to-end fillet tests got measurably
  stronger, not just updated.** Before this change, a ball embedded past a
  curved fillet's resting distance only asserted it moved "meaningfully"
  back toward that surface, because the old combined penetration+velocity
  term left the ball with residual velocity to keep coasting on after the
  correction resolved. After this change, the same tests assert the ball
  settles at (not past) its exact resting distance, since the new push
  channel leaves no such residual velocity behind — independent,
  live-`PhysicsWorld` confirmation that this fix does what it claims.
- All 12 of `solver.rs`'s pre-existing tests pass unchanged, confirming
  splitting the old combined `rhs` term into separate `rhs`/
  `rhs_penetration` fields is behavior-preserving for every case they
  already covered.
- Still open: warm-starting/sleeping (a *bouncy* resting contact still
  re-solves from zero every frame and never settles — a different
  symptom split impulse doesn't address) and the average-not-max
  restitution/friction combine mode.
- 2 new tests, 258 total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+2 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-033`'s 256).

## Genuine goal net
**2026-08-31** · [PR #75](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/75) · `e1ffb4f`

- **Each goal now has a real mass-spring net catching the ball**, replacing
  part of `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`'s solid-bounding-box stand-in with actual
  springy/catching behavior — the "ball tangles in netting" case this
  project's own Non-goals had left open since FR-029 shipped.
- **New `net` module (`net::NetMesh`)**: a rectangular grid of point masses
  (each a real `RigidBody::sphere`, deliberately tiny and light) connected
  by structural (horizontal/vertical) and shear (diagonal) springs (Hooke's
  law plus velocity damping). Every point on the grid's own perimeter is
  anchored — fixed in place, representing the net's real attachment to the
  rigid goal frame (crossbar, both posts, the ground/back line) — while
  every interior point is free to move under gravity, spring forces, and
  ball contact.
- **Reuses existing machinery instead of a bespoke penalty-force system**:
  the ball's contact against each free net point goes through a new
  `collision::sphere_vs_sphere` (this crate's first real sphere-vs-sphere
  contact test — previously an unimplemented placeholder with no caller)
  plus the *existing* `solver::resolve_contacts_between` two-body
  sequential-impulse path, the exact same machinery ball-vs-car and
  car-vs-car contacts already use. `NetMesh::step` sub-steps its own
  internal physics for numerical stability, since a mass-spring system
  this stiff would go unstable integrated with a single large
  Bullet-style step.
- **New `arena::standard_nets`** builds one net panel per goal, positioned
  `NET_DEPTH` behind the real back wall — well in front of `FR-029`'s own
  rigid back-of-net plane, which stays completely unchanged as an
  always-there backstop. `PhysicsWorld` gains `nets`/`with_net`, resolved
  after every other contact each step.
- **Scoped to the ball only, on purpose**: a car still passes straight
  through a net panel's own spatial footprint untouched, stopped instead
  by `FR-029`'s pre-existing solid bounding box — a documented Non-goal,
  not an oversight. Also out of scope: a full 3D "sock" shape billowing
  backward from the goal mouth (this models a single flat rest-shape
  panel, which still deforms backward dynamically under a real ball
  impact via its own springs), and bending stiffness.
- **Every new constant is an uncalibrated placeholder** — real Rocket
  League net material properties have never been published, and this
  port's own point-mass/spring topology is already a simplification of a
  real net's continuum cloth behavior, so a "correct" numeric match isn't
  a coherent target yet either way.
- 10 new tests: 5 in `net.rs` (perimeter anchoring, zero-stretch springs at
  rest, anchored points immovable under gravity, an undisturbed net
  settling instead of oscillating forever, and the real catching proof — a
  ball fired at the net's own center loses over half its speed within 1
  simulated second compared to free flight); `collision.rs` replaced the
  old `contacts_between_two_spheres_is_empty` regression test with 2
  proving `sphere_vs_sphere`'s own correctness; 2 in `arena.rs`; 2 in
  `world.rs` (a wiring-count test plus the real live end-to-end proof — a
  ball fired at a lone net panel in an isolated minimal scene loses at
  least half its speed compared to the identical shot with no net
  present). 256 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+10 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-032`'s 246).

## Curved-fillet narrow-phase investigation
**2026-08-31** · [PR #73](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/73) · `51e633a`

- **Investigated a claimed corner-testing under-detection bug for a car vs.
  a curved fillet, found it doesn't exist — no change to the narrow phase
  itself.** `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027`'s own doc comments claimed
  `box_vs_quarter_pipe`/`box_vs_corner_fillet`'s per-corner technique was
  an approximation, not a full convex-vs-curved-surface narrow phase: a box
  face resting flush against a shallow curve could have every corner still
  clear of the fillet while the face's middle already overlapped it,
  under-detecting that case.
- **Built the fix, and it broke real tests.** A from-scratch GJK
  closest-points implementation was built and wired in to replace the
  per-corner technique — doing so broke two pre-existing, previously-passing
  end-to-end tests, because closest-point is the wrong question for this
  contact: a quarter-pipe/corner-fillet's contact test is a *containment*
  question (is the box's farthest point from the axis/center at or beyond
  radius), not a nearest-point one.
- **The math**: distance-from-a-line/point is a convex function of
  position, and the maximum of a convex function over a convex polytope
  (the box) is always attained at one of its extreme points — its 8
  corners — never a face's interior. So the original per-corner technique
  computes the exact same answer a full narrow phase would, just via
  enumeration instead of an iterative solver — it was never an
  approximation for this specific question.
- **Reverted the code, kept the finding.** `box_vs_quarter_pipe`/
  `box_vs_corner_fillet` are unchanged from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027`; the
  GJK module has been deleted entirely (no remaining consumer). Every doc
  comment across the crate and its spec that had inherited FR-027's
  unverified claim (`lib.rs`'s crate doc, `RB-PHYSICS-001`'s own scope,
  Non-goals, Requirements, and Verification plan sections) now reflects the
  corrected, verified understanding.
- **The goal wall's own analogous window-edge concern remains open** — the
  window boundary is a flat rectangle, not a curve, so it's a distinct
  question this investigation didn't cover.
- 1 new test:
  `collision::tests::no_point_on_a_boxs_face_is_ever_farther_from_a_quarter_pipes_axis_than_its_own_corners`,
  densely sampling (50×50 grid per face) all 6 faces of a car-sized box
  positioned exactly like the two tests that broke, confirming no
  face-interior point ever exceeds the box's own 8 corners' maximum
  distance from the axis. 246 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+1 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-031`'s 245).

## Constant-calibration audit
**2026-08-31** · [PR #71](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/71) · `4c7b9a2`

- **A scoped audit of every uncalibrated placeholder constant** in
  `drive.rs`/`arena.rs`, sourced against the community reverse-engineering
  effort — deliberately does NOT close `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`'s real-data
  calibration, which still needs `PHASE-0-EXIT`.
- **Sources**: the RocketSim (`ZealanL/RocketSim`) and RLUtilities
  (`samuelpmish/RLUtilities`) source code plus the RLBot community wiki's
  "Useful Game Values" page — three independently-written references;
  agreement across all three treated as high confidence, a single source
  or an older/casual reference flagged as lower-confidence rather than
  silently trusted.
- **Corrected, with real code/behavior changes**:
  - `drive::JUMP_SPEED`: `292.0` → `875.0/3.0` (≈291.667 uu/s) — matches
    RocketSim's `JUMP_IMMEDIATE_FORCE` and RLUtilities' `Jump::speed`
    exactly; also confirmed to be the double jump's own impulse, unchanged.
  - `drive::JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION`: `1400.0` → `4375.0/3.0` (≈1458.33
    uu/s²) — matches RocketSim's `JUMP_ACCEL` and RLUtilities'
    `Jump::acceleration` exactly.
  - **New `drive::UNBOOSTED_MAX_CAR_SPEED = 1410.0`** — a genuine bug fix,
    not just a doc update: before this audit, throttle alone shared
    `MAX_CAR_SPEED` (2300, Rocket League's *boosted* top speed) as its own
    cap, letting a car reach boosted top speed on throttle alone.
    Throttle now caps at this new, separate, real unboosted-top-speed
    constant instead; `MAX_CAR_SPEED` keeps its already-correct role as
    boost's own cap.
- **Confirmed already correct, no change** (recorded as *confirmed*, not
  merely *unchanged*): `drive::JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION` (0.2),
  `drive::BOOST_ACCELERATION` (991.667), `drive::MAX_BOOST` (100), gravity
  (-650), `arena::GOAL_DEPTH` (880).
- **Explicitly flagged as audited-but-still-uncalibrated** — a real
  reference exists but doesn't safely port into this port's own unit
  system or mechanic shape, or no reference exists at all:
  `drive::DODGE_SPEED` (real dodge impulse is a direction/speed-scaled
  curve, not a flat number, and adopting just its base magnitude would
  collide with `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED`), `drive::DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`
  (real flip spin is torque-based against a specific hitbox inertia tensor,
  not a flat rad/s), `drive::WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` (real Rocket
  League has no separate wall-jump speed at all — it reuses the plain jump
  impulse along the contact normal), `drive::STEER_TORQUE`/
  `drive::AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE`/`drive::HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`/
  `drive::LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE` (real torque/friction-curve values
  exist but are calibrated to real Rocket League's own specific car
  mass/inertia, which this port's placeholder car body isn't confirmed to
  match), and `arena::FILLET_RADIUS`/`arena::CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` (Rocket
  League's real corner geometry is a triangulated collision mesh, not an
  analytic arc — no single-number reference exists anywhere).
- **Two open ambiguities surfaced, deliberately not acted on**: this
  port's ball radius (`92.75`) is an older, casually-cited figure, while
  RocketSim/RLUtilities/the current RLBot wiki all converge on `91.25` as
  the real simulation collision radius — not changed since `92.75` is
  load-bearing across a large fraction of this crate's existing tests;
  `arena::CEILING_Z` (`2044.0`) vs. RocketSim's `ARENA_HEIGHT = 2048.f` —
  unclear whether they describe the same reference point. Both recorded as
  open questions for a future, deliberate change.
- 1 new test: `drive::tests::throttle_alone_cannot_reach_the_boosted_top_speed`.
  245 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+1 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-030`'s 244).

## Combined multi-body solve
**2026-08-31** · [PR #69](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/69) · `dfbefb4`

- **`PhysicsWorld::step` now resolves every ball-vs-car and car-vs-car
  contact manifold together as one combined multi-body solve**, instead of
  resolving each pair independently and fully applying it before the next
  pair's setup even reads a body's velocity — closing the "3+ bodies
  mutually touching in the same step" approximation this project has
  tracked since multi-car support first landed (e.g. a car pinned between
  the ball and another car).
- **New `solver::resolve_dynamic_manifolds`** takes every dynamic-vs-dynamic
  manifold in the scene at once (`(body_index_a, body_index_b, contacts)`
  triples into a shared `bodies` slice) and gives every body index that
  takes part in at least one manifold its own `DeltaVelocity` accumulator,
  shared across every manifold that body is in for the whole
  `SOLVER_ITERATIONS` loop — a real shared island solve, not a sequence of
  independent pairwise ones. New helper `delta_pair_mut` generalizes the
  `Vec::split_at_mut` disjoint-borrow trick `PhysicsWorld::step`'s
  car-vs-car loop already used (previously only for adjacent indices) to
  arbitrary index pairs. `resolve_contacts_between`'s old `TwoBodyDelta`
  struct is gone — `resolve_two_body_row` now takes each body's
  `DeltaVelocity` separately, which is what makes sharing one accumulator
  across manifolds possible.
- **`PhysicsWorld::step` rewired**: the old per-pair `resolve_dynamic_contact`
  helper (and its two call-site loops) is replaced with collecting every
  non-empty ball-vs-car/car-vs-car manifold into indices against a
  `[ball, car0, car1, ...]` body list, one call to
  `resolve_dynamic_manifolds`, then copying the resolved velocities back
  out. Static contacts (ground, arena walls, curves, corner fillets, goal
  walls, bounded walls) are deliberately unchanged — a body's contact with
  static geometry never depends on another dynamic body, so resolving it
  independently loses no information; only the dynamic-vs-dynamic path
  needed the fix.
- **Measured, not just assumed, improvement**: a left-right symmetric
  "pinch" test (a ball exactly touching two identical, much heavier cars
  closing in from opposite sides at equal speed, restitution zero
  throughout) has a true simultaneous-solve answer of all three bodies
  ending near zero velocity (total momentum is exactly zero). Resolving
  each pair independently left the ball at ~99% of a single car's own
  closing speed — as if the first-resolved contact's effect was almost
  entirely discarded by the second. The combined solve, at this crate's
  existing 10 solver iterations, leaves the ball measurably slower
  (~89.5 vs. ~98.9 units/s in the isolated measurement) but doesn't fully
  converge to zero in that few iterations — a known, common limitation of
  projected Gauss-Seidel solvers for a light body sandwiched between two
  much heavier ones, confirmed (not shipped as a change) by checking that
  many more iterations converge the combined solve's result much closer to
  zero, while the independent-pairwise approach's result doesn't change at
  all no matter how many iterations each individual pairwise call gets —
  proof the old approach's error was structural, not an iteration-count
  shortfall.
- 2 new tests: `solver::tests::resolve_dynamic_manifolds_keeps_more_of_every_bodys_contact_than_resolving_pairs_independently`
  and `world::tests::a_ball_pinched_between_two_closing_cars_is_resolved_by_a_shared_multi_body_solve`.
  244 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+2 over `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-029`'s
  242).

## Modeled goal interior
**2026-08-31** · [PR #67](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/67) · `9b69c0c`

- **A ball or car passing through a goal-mouth window now settles inside a
  bounded goal box** instead of sailing forever into open, unbounded
  space — closing the "modeled goal interior/net" gap repeated across
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-024` through `FR-028`'s own "Still not modeled" lists.
- **New `body::StaticBoundedWall`** collides only *within* a rectangular
  bound in the plane's own local frame — the opposite gate convention from
  `StaticGoalWall`'s window (which collides everywhere *except* inside a
  rectangle). New `collision::sphere_vs_bounded_wall`/`box_vs_bounded_wall`/
  `contacts_vs_bounded_wall` dispatch by shape, the box path using the same
  "test every corner" technique established by FR-027/FR-028 (a corner
  *outside* the bound is skipped, the opposite of `box_vs_goal_wall`'s
  per-corner window test).
- **New `arena::standard_goal_back_walls`** (2 plain, unbounded
  `StaticPlane`s, `GOAL_DEPTH` behind each real back wall) — deliberately
  unbounded, since nothing can reach that plane except by first passing
  through the goal-mouth window. **New `arena::standard_goal_side_walls`**
  (4 bounded walls, reusing `goal_post_plane` completely unchanged) and
  **`arena::standard_goal_roofs`** (2 bounded walls, reusing
  `goal_crossbar_plane` unchanged) — an unbounded plane at either position
  would incorrectly wall off the *entire* main field, the same problem
  those planes' own pre-existing doc comments already documented for their
  original, purely-geometric role.
- **`PhysicsWorld` gains `bounded_walls`/`with_bounded_wall`**, resolved
  for the ball and every car exactly like `goal_walls`.
- **Two real test-design findings worth keeping**: the 3 new live
  end-to-end proofs are deliberately isolated to a minimal scene built
  from just the specific new wall(s) under test, not the full
  `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` — using the full arena, a ball fired
  sideways or upward from deep inside the goal box got flung to wildly
  wrong positions, root-caused to the pre-existing "a `StaticQuarterPipe`'s
  sector-membership test only checks angle, not radial distance"
  limitation, spuriously triggered by the standard arena's own
  goal-cutout-edge fillets sitting near the window. Separately, an early
  version of these tests zeroed only the *ball's* own restitution and got
  nondeterministic results, since the *wall's* own default 0.5 restitution
  still applied in the solver — fixed by zeroing the wall's restitution
  too.
- **Still not modeled**: a genuine net *mesh* — this models a solid
  bounding volume standing in for the net's functional role, not
  springy/catching netting or a real net's own visual sag.
- 4 new tests in `body.rs`, 5 in `collision.rs`, 8 in `arena.rs`, and 4 in
  `world.rs` (1 wiring-count + 3 live end-to-end proofs, plus a
  pre-existing wall-count test in `world.rs` renamed to match the 2 new
  back-of-net planes). 242 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+21 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-028`'s 221).

## Car actually driving into a goal
**2026-08-31** · [PR #65](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/65) · `3141f1e`

- **A car (box) can now actually drive into a goal**, closing the last
  goal-related Non-goal repeated across `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-024` through
  `FR-027` — until now, `collision::contacts_vs_goal_wall` sent a car
  straight through to an unwindowed `contacts_vs_plane`, so it always
  collided with the full, solid back wall even though the ball already
  passed through the goal-mouth window.
- **New `collision::box_vs_goal_wall`** tests each of a box's 8 corners
  individually against `StaticGoalWall::contains_in_window` — a corner
  whose own projection falls inside the window contributes no contact at
  all, the same pass-through rule `sphere_vs_goal_wall` already applies to
  the ball's single center point, applied per corner instead. A corner
  outside the window behaves exactly like an ordinary `box_vs_plane`
  corner test.
- **A real emergent behavior, not a separate feature**: a car only partly
  lined up with the window (straddling one of its edges) gets a genuine
  partial block — the corners still outside the window register contacts
  and stop the car there, while the corners inside register none — rather
  than the all-or-nothing result a single-point sphere test necessarily
  produces.
- **`contacts_vs_goal_wall` now dispatches a `Shape::Box` to
  `box_vs_goal_wall`** instead of falling through to `contacts_vs_plane`.
  No `PhysicsWorld::step` changes were needed — exactly like FR-027's own
  discovery, `resolve_goal_wall_contact` was already being called for
  every car in the scene (it always needed the wall's plain-plane
  collision even before this fix).
- **Still not modeled**: a modeled goal interior/net — the goal opens onto
  open, unbounded space beyond the back wall for a car now too, not a
  bounded volume. Tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 3 new tests in `collision.rs` (replacing 1 obsolete "ignores the window
  entirely" regression test) and 2 new tests in `world.rs` (replacing 1
  obsolete "still stopped by the back wall" regression test), including a
  live end-to-end proof that a car fired at the goal-mouth center actually
  passes the back wall. 221 tests total in `rb_physics_bullet` (+3 over
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-027`'s 218).

## Car deflection by curved fillets
**2026-08-31** · [PR #63](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/63) · `f13e5f5`

- **A car (box) is now actually deflected by every curved fillet in this
  port**, closing the Non-goal repeated across every fillet increment
  since `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-020` — until now, a car drove straight through
  wall-to-floor/ceiling seams, corner-wall vertical edges, compound
  corners, and goal-cutout edges, untouched; only the ball was ever
  deflected.
- **New `collision::box_vs_quarter_pipe`/`box_vs_corner_fillet`** reuse the
  same "test every corner" technique `box_vs_plane` already used for a
  flat plane — each of a box's 8 corners is checked as a zero-radius
  sphere via the existing `sphere_vs_quarter_pipe`/`sphere_vs_corner_fillet`,
  and every corner that reports a contact contributes one to the manifold.
  Each surviving contact's `point` is overwritten to the corner's own
  world position (not the fillet-surface point those functions themselves
  compute), for the same rel_pos/torque-accuracy reason `box_vs_plane`'s
  own doc comment already gives.
- **`contacts_vs_quarter_pipe`/`contacts_vs_corner_fillet` now dispatch a
  `Shape::Box` to these** instead of `Vec::new()`. No `PhysicsWorld::step`
  changes were needed at all — `resolve_curve_contact`/
  `resolve_corner_fillet_contact` were already being called for every car
  in the scene, just as a silent no-op until now.
- **Documented as an approximation, not a full convex-vs-curved-surface
  narrow phase** (no GJK/EPA support-mapping machinery was added): a box
  face resting flush against a shallow curve can have every one of its
  own corners still just clear of the fillet while the face's middle
  already overlaps it, under-detecting that case — the same "exact per
  test-point, an approximation of the whole shape" caveat this crate has
  always carried for curved geometry.
- **`StaticGoalWall`/`contacts_vs_goal_wall` is unaffected** — a goal wall
  isn't a curved fillet, so a car still sees the same solid, full-width
  back wall it always has, and still can't drive into a goal.
- 3 net new/replaced unit tests across `collision.rs`/`world.rs` in
  `rb_physics_bullet` (218 total): `collision.rs` replaced its two old
  "box vs. curved fillet is always empty" regression tests with proofs
  that an embedded box gets a correctly-directed contact and a
  clearly-outside-the-sector/bounds box still gets none; `world.rs`
  replaced `a_car_is_not_deflected_by_a_curved_transition` (whose entire
  premise this increment reverses) with an end-to-end proof that a car
  resting within a curve's footprint gets pushed up exactly like the ball
  does, and added a compound-corner-fillet car test checking the car's
  *worst corner penetration* shrinks rather than that its center of mass
  approaches the fillet's center (the way the equivalent ball test
  checks) — an oriented box's corners sit at different depths at once, so
  resolving one corner's contact can rotate the box in a way that moves
  its center away from the fillet even as every individual corner's own
  overlap is being corrected. This was found empirically (an earlier,
  center-of-mass-based assertion actually failed) and led to the more
  careful, still-correct invariant.

## Goal post-crossbar corner fillets
**2026-08-31** · [#61](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/61) · `c179716`

- **Rounds off the two compound corners per goal where a post's own
  vertical edge fillet meets the crossbar's own horizontal edge fillet**,
  one per post per goal (4 total) — closing a gap `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-024`'s
  own doc comment explicitly flagged as deliberately not blended into a
  single smooth vertex.
- **New `arena::standard_goal_corner_fillets`** builds all 4 directly via
  `StaticCornerFillet::between_three_planes` on the real back wall/post/
  crossbar planes that meet there — the same approach
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-023` used for the arena's own 16 compound corners. No
  new shape or collision code needed: `StaticCornerFillet`/
  `sphere_vs_corner_fillet` already generalize to any three non-parallel
  planes.
- **Reuses `FILLET_RADIUS` unchanged.** Unlike `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-025`'s
  arena corners, both edge fillets meeting at a goal's post-crossbar
  corner already share one radius, so there's no mismatched-radius concern
  requiring a dedicated constant.
- **The goal's other two corners, where a post meets the floor, get no
  such treatment** — the window's own bottom edge sits exactly at floor
  level, so a post's own fillet there simply ends flush with the ground
  the ball already rolls on, not a sharp, unrounded vertex needing a
  blend.
- **`PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` wires the 4 new fillets in** via the
  same `with_corner_fillet` builder `standard_corner_fillets`'s 16 already
  used, bringing `corner_fillets` to 20 total.
- 3 new unit tests across `arena.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (215
  total): 2 in `arena.rs` — `standard_goal_corner_fillets_has_four_fillets`
  and `every_goal_corner_fillets_center_sits_radius_in_from_a_back_wall_a_post_and_the_crossbar`
  (proving every fillet's center sits `FILLET_RADIUS` in from a back wall,
  a post plane, and the crossbar plane simultaneously — a real triple
  intersection, not an arbitrary point); 1 in `world.rs` —
  `a_ball_embedded_in_a_goal_corner_fillets_footprint_is_pushed_toward_the_center`,
  the real end-to-end proof, a ball embedded past a goal corner fillet's
  own radius gets pushed meaningfully back toward the center.

## Corner-wall floor/ceiling arch radius
**2026-08-31** · [#59](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/59) · `ff1391a`

- **A diagonal corner wall's own floor-seam and ceiling-seam fillets are now
  distinctly larger than a cardinal wall's**, matching real Rocket League's
  noticeably bigger, more swept corner-boost curve rather than a
  scaled-down copy of a cardinal wall's small rounding.
- **New `arena::CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` (750 uu)**, an uncalibrated placeholder
  like every other arena dimension in this crate (no verified reference for
  the real arch's actual radius, chosen only to read as visibly larger than
  `FILLET_RADIUS` (292 uu)). The 8 of `standard_curves`'s 24 fillets that
  bridge a corner wall to the floor or ceiling now use it instead of
  `FILLET_RADIUS`; a compile-time
  `const _: () = assert!(CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS > FILLET_RADIUS);` enforces the
  "distinctly larger" relationship.
- **All 16 `standard_corner_fillets` switch to `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` too.**
  `StaticCornerFillet::between_three_planes` needs one shared radius across
  all three planes it blends to still meet its adjoining edge fillets
  exactly where their axes cross (the same no-gap property
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-023` established) — every one of the 16 compound
  corners touches one of the 8 now-bigger corner-wall arches, so a
  mismatched radius there wouldn't blend cleanly.
- **Unaffected, still `FILLET_RADIUS`:** the 8 cardinal-wall floor/ceiling
  seams, the 8 vertical corner-edge fillets (`FR-022`), and the 6
  goal-cutout edge fillets (`FR-024`) — independent, additive contact
  sources next to the bigger arches, not blended with them, the same
  convention every other adjoining-fillet pair in this module already uses.
- **Discovered and fixed a real regression while validating**: `body::StaticQuarterPipe`
  is documented as infinite along its own axis, not clipped to a corner
  wall's real, finite span — a ball fired dead down the arena's own center
  line eventually re-enters some corner-wall arch's resting shell far past
  the goal, a pre-existing (already-documented) property that was already
  true with the old, smaller `FILLET_RADIUS` (a mild, harmless correction
  around y≈7650-7930 there), but `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS` moves that zone closer
  in (y≈6300-7700) and turns the same brush into a much sharper,
  solver-destabilizing correction (velocities spiking to tens of thousands
  of units/sec). Fixed by shortening the pre-existing `world.rs` test
  `a_ball_shot_through_the_goal_mouth_passes_the_standard_arenas_back_wall`'s
  simulated flight duration (3.0s → 1.8s) — still comfortably long enough to
  prove the ball clears the back wall, but short enough to stop before
  re-entering that already-documented infinite-fillet zone. A test-scoping
  fix, not a new capability or a new documented Non-goal.
- 1 new unit test in `world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (212 total): the real
  end-to-end proof, `a_ball_embedded_in_a_corner_walls_floor_arch_footprint_is_pushed_toward_the_axis`
  — a ball embedded past a corner wall's floor arch's own (larger) radius
  gets pushed meaningfully back toward the axis, asserting
  `CORNER_ARCH_RADIUS > FILLET_RADIUS` along the way.

## Goal cutouts
**2026-08-30** · [#57](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/57) · `34234b6`

- **Opens an actual goal-mouth window in each back wall**, where every
  prior increment had a single solid, flat plane spanning the full width.
- **New static shape `body::StaticGoalWall`.** A `StaticPlane` plus a
  rectangular window in the plane's own local `u_axis`/`v_axis` frame
  (`window_center`, `half_width`, `half_height`) — the same "derive an
  axis/window in the plane's own local frame rather than assuming a world
  axis" discipline `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes`'s `axis_direction`
  generalization (`FR-022`) established. `contains_in_window` tests a
  point's projection onto `u_axis`/`v_axis` alone, independent of the
  point's own depth from the plane along `plane.normal`.
- **`collision::sphere_vs_goal_wall`/`contacts_vs_goal_wall` dispatch by
  shape.** A sphere (the ball) gets no contact at all when its center
  falls inside the window, letting it pass straight through; a box (car)
  falls straight through to the ordinary `contacts_vs_plane` against the
  wrapped plane, deliberately ignoring the window entirely — a
  zero-regression choice, since a car now sees literally the same
  contact-generation call it always did against a back wall.
- **`arena::standard_walls` drops the 2 back-wall `StaticPlane`s it used
  to return** (now 7 planes instead of 9); new `arena::standard_goal_walls`
  returns them instead as 2 `StaticGoalWall`s, windowed at new
  commonly-cited constants `GOAL_HALF_WIDTH`/`GOAL_HEIGHT` (same sourcing
  caveat as `SIDE_WALL_X`), each centered on its own wall at half the
  goal's own height.
- **New `arena::standard_goal_cutout_fillets` rounds each window's 3
  edges** (two vertical posts, one horizontal crossbar, times 2 goals — 6
  `StaticQuarterPipe`s, added to the same `curves` list `standard_curves`'s
  24 already populate). Each is derived via the existing
  `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` from the real back-wall plane and a
  second, purely-geometric plane (`goal_post_plane`/`goal_crossbar_plane`)
  representing the post's or crossbar's own inward-/downward-facing
  surface — positioned at exactly the window's own edge, so the fillet's
  tangent point lands exactly on the window boundary with no gap or
  overlap. Unlike a real wall, these post/crossbar planes are never
  themselves added as collision geometry: an infinite plane facing
  straight along X (or capping Z) would incorrectly wall off the *entire*
  rest of the field at that coordinate, unlike a diagonal corner wall's
  own orientation, which stays non-binding everywhere except right at the
  true corner.
- **`PhysicsWorld` gains `goal_walls`/`with_goal_wall`/
  `resolve_goal_wall_contact`**, resolved for the ball *and* every car
  (unlike `curves`/`corner_fillets`'s ball-only resolution) — safe
  precisely because the box path is a no-op change from the prior
  plain-`StaticPlane` behavior. `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` wires in
  both the goal walls and the goal-cutout fillets automatically.
- **Still not modeled:** a car (box) actually being deflected by any
  fillet or driving into a goal, a modeled goal interior/net beyond the
  cutout itself (the ball passes into open space, not a bounded volume),
  and the goal's own two compound top corners where a post's fillet meets
  the crossbar's (independent, additive fillets there, same "no blended
  3D corner" approach the arena's corner-wall edges used before `FR-023`).
- 17 new unit tests across `body.rs`/`collision.rs`/`arena.rs`/`world.rs`
  in `rb_physics_bullet` (211 total): 4 in `body.rs` proving
  `contains_in_window` is true at the window's own center and just inside
  each of its four edges, false just outside them, and unaffected by a
  point's distance from the plane; 4 in `collision.rs` — a sphere embedded
  in the window has no contact, a sphere outside the window behaves
  exactly like an ordinary plane contact both embedded and resting exactly
  at the surface, and a box's contact through the windowed wall is
  bit-for-bit identical to plain `contacts_vs_plane` against the same
  wrapped plane; 5 in `arena.rs` — `standard_walls` returns exactly 7
  planes, `standard_goal_walls` returns exactly 2 sharing one offset
  magnitude with each window centered correctly, `standard_goal_cutout_fillets`
  returns exactly 6 fillets each sitting radius-in from a real back wall
  and a post/crossbar plane; 4 in `world.rs` — `standard_arena` carries
  exactly 2 goal walls, a ball fired through a goal-mouth window's center
  passes the back wall's own position while a car aimed at the same spot
  is still stopped by it, and an end-to-end test proving a ball embedded
  past a goal-post fillet's own radius gets pushed meaningfully back
  toward the axis.

## Compound-corner fillets
**2026-08-30** · [#55](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/55) · `5d2db86`

- **Rounds off the last 16 sharp vertices in the standard arena's vertical
  boundary** — the compound corners where a corner wall's own vertical-edge
  fillet (`FR-022`) meets a floor- or ceiling-seam fillet (`FR-020`/`FR-021`),
  near that corner wall's own top or bottom endpoint.
- **New static shape `body::StaticCornerFillet`.** A compound corner is
  where *three* planes meet at once, which no existing cylindrical
  `StaticQuarterPipe` can blend, so this requirement introduces a genuinely
  different shape: an immovable sphere riding the concave inside of the
  vertex, the same "ride the inside" convention every prior fillet already
  uses, generalized from a cylinder to a sphere.
- **`between_three_planes` derives the center as three planes' common
  intersection, not solved from scratch.** It reuses the same "radius-in
  from every bridged plane" invariant `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes`
  already established: since the fillet's center must sit exactly `radius`
  in from all three planes, it's also exactly `radius` in from each *pair*
  of them — meaning it already lies on all three of that vertex's own
  pairwise `between_planes` axis lines simultaneously. So the center is
  nothing more than those three lines' common intersection point, solved
  directly via the classic three-plane-intersection cross-product form of
  Cramer's rule.
- **Containment generalizes a 2-sided sector test to a "spherical
  triangle."** New `collision::sphere_vs_corner_fillet`: a direction from
  the center is inside the fillet iff its dot product with each of 3
  `bounds` is non-negative. Each bound is the raw (deliberately
  non-normalized — only its sign is used) cross product of a pair of the
  three normals, sign-corrected via `signed_pair_axis` (checking the third,
  non-pair plane's own normal against it) to always point toward the sharp
  corner this fillet replaces — provably correct because that dot product
  is exactly the derivative of the third plane's own signed distance along
  a candidate direction. No `.normalize()`/`.unwrap()` is needed or used
  anywhere in this new production code, the same discipline
  `between_planes`'s own `FR-022` self-correction established.
- **`arena::standard_corner_fillets` builds all 16** (4 per corner wall —
  floor+side, floor+back, ceiling+side, ceiling+back — times the 4 corner
  walls) directly from the same three flat planes `standard_walls` already
  builds, reusing `FILLET_RADIUS` once again rather than a fourth radius
  constant.
- **`PhysicsWorld` gains `corner_fillets`/`with_corner_fillet`/
  `resolve_corner_fillet_contact`**, mirroring `curves`/`with_curve`/
  `resolve_curve_contact` exactly — a no-op for a car, the same documented
  deferred case as every other fillet here. `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena`
  wires in all 16 automatically.
- **Still not modeled:** a car (box) actually being deflected by any
  fillet, and goal cutouts in the back walls.
- 13 new unit tests across `body.rs`/`collision.rs`/`arena.rs`/`world.rs`
  in `rb_physics_bullet` (194 total): 4 in `body.rs`, using a synthetic
  fixture combining a perpendicular floor with the same 45-degree
  non-perpendicular wall pair `between_planes`'s own `FR-022` fixture
  uses — the center sits radius-in from all three planes with tangent
  points exactly on each, and the derived `bounds` correctly include the
  direction toward the sharp corner and exclude the direction pointing
  away from it; 5 in `collision.rs`, mirroring `sphere_vs_quarter_pipe`'s
  own test shapes (deep-inside no contact, touching zero penetration,
  pushed-past positive penetration toward the center, outside-bounds no
  contact, box always empty); 2 in `arena.rs` — `standard_corner_fillets`
  returns exactly 16 fillets, and every fillet's center sits radius-in
  from a floor/ceiling plane, a side/back wall, and a corner wall
  simultaneously; 2 in `world.rs` — `standard_arena` carries exactly 16
  corner fillets, plus the real end-to-end proof, a ball embedded past a
  compound-corner fillet's own radius gets pushed meaningfully back toward
  the center.

## Curved corner-wall vertical-edge fillets
**2026-08-30** · [#53](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/53) · `d466ae2`

- **Rounds off the standard arena's last remaining sharp edges** — the 8
  vertical edges where each of the 4 diagonal corner walls meets its
  neighboring side or back wall. `arena::standard_curves` now returns 24
  `StaticQuarterPipe`s (the 16 floor/ceiling-seam fillets `FR-020`/`FR-021`
  already built, plus 8 vertical-edge fillets, one per corner-wall
  endpoint).
- **Generalized `StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` to any two non-parallel
  planes, not just perpendicular ones.** Unlike every prior fillet in this
  port, the two planes a vertical-edge fillet bridges *aren't*
  perpendicular — a corner wall meets its neighboring side/back wall at 135
  degrees (given `standard_walls`' 45-degree corner cut), not 90. This
  exposed a real gap: `between_planes` previously only computed the correct
  axis point for perpendicular planes, via a shortcut (summing the two
  scaled normals) that silently gives the *wrong* point at any other angle.
  It now solves the axis point as an actual 2x2 linear system in the
  (possibly non-orthogonal) basis the two normals form, and its own sector
  angle comes out to exactly the angle between the two planes' normals — a
  right angle for perpendicular planes as before, or (for these
  vertical-edge fillets) a shallow 45 degrees, the supplement of the walls'
  135-degree dihedral angle.
- **Generalized `sphere_vs_quarter_pipe`'s sector-membership test** from the
  old two-dot-products check (only correct for a 90-degree sector, since
  its two edges happen to be perpendicular) to a signed-cross-product test
  against `axis_direction`, exact for any sector up to 180 degrees — the
  widest a sensible fillet-replacing-a-corner can ever be.
- **`between_planes` self-corrects a "backwards" `axis_direction`
  internally**, since the general sector test (unlike the old
  perpendicular-only one) depends on `axis_direction`'s own sign/handedness:
  it flips the input if `cross(sector_start, sector_end)` doesn't already
  point the right way, so a caller can pass either of the two opposite
  directions along the shared edge line without reasoning about which one
  is correct.
- **The vertical-edge fillets' own `axis_direction` is simply `(0, 0, 1)`**
  — the edge itself is vertical — no cross product needed, unlike the
  corner-wall floor/ceiling-seam case `FR-021` introduced.
  **`FILLET_RADIUS` is reused as-is** once again, rather than a separate,
  smaller radius for these visibly shallower edges.
- **Still not modeled:** a car (box) actually being deflected by any
  fillet, the compound corner where a vertical-edge fillet meets a floor-
  or ceiling-seam fillet (near a corner wall's own top/bottom endpoint —
  this port models each fillet as an independent, additive contact source,
  not a blended 3D corner), and goal cutouts in the back walls.
- 9 new unit tests across `body.rs`/`arena.rs`/`world.rs` in
  `rb_physics_bullet` (181 total): 5 in `body.rs`, using a synthetic
  non-perpendicular fixture independent of the arena's own geometry — the
  axis still sits exactly `radius` in from both planes with tangent points
  exactly on each; the derived sector angle matches the angle between the
  two planes' normals (45 degrees for this fixture); the sharp corner the
  fillet replaces sits outside its own radius but within its sector (the
  real proof the generalized sector orientation actually faces the missing
  material, not away from it); and passing either of the two opposite
  `axis_direction` choices produces the same correctly-oriented sector; 3
  in `arena.rs` — `standard_curves` returns exactly 24 fillets, every
  vertical-edge fillet's `axis_direction` runs purely along Z, and a corner
  wall's own vertical-edge fillet sits radius-in from both the corner wall
  and its neighboring side wall with a 45-degree sector; 1 in `world.rs` —
  the real end-to-end proof, a ball embedded past a vertical-edge fillet's
  own radius (at a wall-to-wall angle that isn't a right angle) gets pushed
  meaningfully back toward the axis (not a claim that it settles and stays
  at the exact resting distance — its contact stops firing once the
  overlap resolves, so nothing cancels whatever residual velocity the
  correction left the ball with, the same reason `FR-020`'s and `FR-021`'s
  own equivalent tests make the same weaker, "moved meaningfully" claim).

## Curved corner-wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling transitions
**2026-08-30** · [#51](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/51) · `d746d08`

- **Extends `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-020`'s fillet treatment to the 4 diagonal
  corner walls** `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-019` introduced — `arena::standard_curves`
  now returns 16 `StaticQuarterPipe`s (still one floor-side and one
  ceiling-side fillet per wall, now for all 9 walls) instead of 8.
- **`StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes` needed no code changes.** Its real
  correctness requirement was never "axis-aligned planes" (as FR-020's own
  doc comment had incorrectly claimed) — only that the two bridged planes'
  normals, plus `axis_direction`, form an orthonormal basis, which only
  needs the two planes to be mutually *perpendicular*. A vertical wall's
  normal always has zero Z component while the floor/ceiling's is always
  purely Z, so this holds for a corner wall regardless of its own
  horizontal rotation, not just for a cardinal wall.
- **A corner wall's fillet `axis_direction` is computed via a cross
  product** (`floor.normal.cross(&wall.normal)`, and the ceiling
  equivalent) rather than hand-picked, since — unlike a cardinal wall's —
  it isn't a coordinate axis. The cross product of two always-perpendicular
  unit vectors is already exactly unit length by construction, so no
  `.normalize()`/`.unwrap()` is needed (avoiding a `clippy::unwrap_used`
  violation the workspace's lint config promotes to a hard CI error in
  production code).
- **A new `corner_wall_plane(sx, sy)` helper in `arena.rs`** factors out the
  existing (behavior-unchanged) corner-wall plane construction
  `standard_walls` already did inline, so `standard_curves` can reuse it
  rather than duplicating the math. `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` picks up
  the extra 8 curves automatically, since it already loops over every curve
  `arena::standard_curves()` returns.
- **`FILLET_RADIUS` is reused as-is** for the corner-wall fillets rather
  than introducing a second, independently chosen radius.
- **Still not modeled:** a car (box) actually being deflected by any fillet
  (unchanged from FR-020), a fillet at a corner wall's own *vertical* edges
  — where it meets its neighboring side/back wall at other than 90 degrees,
  a materially different problem since `between_planes` only handles two
  perpendicular planes — and goal cutouts in the back walls.
- 4 new unit tests across `arena.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (172
  total): `standard_curves` returns exactly 16 fillets; every fillet's axis
  sits exactly `FILLET_RADIUS` in from some vertical wall, cardinal or
  corner; a corner wall's own derived fillet axis sits exactly
  `FILLET_RADIUS` in from both the corner wall and the floor, with
  correctly perpendicular unit sector vectors; the cross product computing
  each of the 4 corner walls' `axis_direction` is exactly unit length,
  confirming the production code's `.normalize()`-free assumption actually
  holds — plus, the real end-to-end proof, a new `PhysicsWorld` test built
  around a wall with a diagonal (non-axis-aligned) normal, rather than
  going through `arena::standard_curves` directly, confirms a ball resting
  at ordinary flat-floor height within that diagonal wall's fillet
  footprint gets pushed up off it, the same physical proof FR-020 gave for
  a cardinal wall, now for one whose normal isn't a coordinate axis.

## Curved wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling transitions
**2026-08-30** · [#49](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/49) · `8053a71`

- **Added:** a new `body::StaticQuarterPipe` shape — an immovable
  partial-cylinder fillet connecting two perpendicular flat planes,
  infinite along its own axis like `StaticPlane` — and `collision::
  contacts_vs_quarter_pipe`, a sphere-only narrow-phase test
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-020`).
- **The playable side is the *inside* of the fillet's concave face** — the
  same geometry a skateboard quarter-pipe is named after and ridden on the
  inside of. A point is governed by a fillet at all only when its
  direction from `axis_point`, projected perpendicular to
  `axis_direction`, falls within the 90-degree sector from `sector_start`
  to `sector_end` (checked via `dot(dir, sector_start) >= 0 && dot(dir,
  sector_end) >= 0`, exact for a 90-degree sector since the two vectors
  are perpendicular); within that sector, contact fires as the sphere's
  surface approaches or crosses the fillet's own radius *from inside*, and
  the correction pushes the sphere back toward the axis — the opposite
  direction convention from `sphere_vs_plane`'s always-away-from-the-plane
  push.
- **`StaticQuarterPipe::between_planes(plane_a, plane_b, radius,
  axis_direction)`** derives a fillet's axis/sector automatically from the
  two flat planes it bridges (offsetting each plane inward by `radius`
  along its own normal, negating each plane's normal for the sector vector
  pointing back to its own tangent point) — exact only when `plane_a`/
  `plane_b`'s normals and `axis_direction` form an orthonormal basis (true
  for every cardinal arena wall's own floor/ceiling seam, not a diagonal
  corner wall's).
- **`PhysicsWorld` gains `curves: Vec<StaticQuarterPipe>` and a
  `with_curve` builder** (mirroring `walls`/`with_wall`), resolved via a
  new `resolve_curve_contact` alongside `resolve_plane_contact` for the
  ball and every car — a no-op for cars, since the box arm of
  `contacts_vs_quarter_pipe` is always empty.
- **`solver::resolve_contacts`'s second parameter changed from
  `&StaticPlane` to plain `restitution: f32, friction: f32`** — the only
  two fields it ever actually used — so this same solver path serves a
  `StaticQuarterPipe` fillet exactly as it already served a `StaticPlane`,
  with no new solver code needed.
- **`arena::standard_curves`** builds the 8 fillets (floor-side and
  ceiling-side, for each of the 4 cardinal walls) the standard arena needs,
  via `between_planes`, using a new uncalibrated placeholder
  `FILLET_RADIUS` — this port has no verified reference for the real
  transition radius either, same status as `arena::CORNER_LENGTH`.
  `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` now adds these 8 curves alongside its
  existing 9 walls.
- **Still not modeled:** a car (box) actually being deflected by a fillet
  (needs real support-mapping/SAT-style collision machinery against curved
  geometry this port doesn't have yet), fillets at the 4 diagonal corner
  walls (their non-axis-aligned normals don't satisfy `between_planes`'
  orthonormal-basis assumption), and goal cutouts in the back walls.
- 15 new unit tests across `body.rs`/`collision.rs`/`arena.rs`/`world.rs`
  in `rb_physics_bullet` (168 total): the derived fillet geometry sits
  exactly `radius` in from both bridged planes with correctly-directed,
  perpendicular unit sector vectors and tangent points exactly on each
  plane; a sphere deep inside a fillet has no contact, touching it has
  zero penetration, pushed past it has positive penetration pushing back
  toward the axis, and outside the 90-degree sector has no contact
  regardless of absolute distance; a box against a fillet always returns
  no contact; `standard_curves` returns exactly 8 fillets, each sitting
  radius-in from the floor/ceiling and a cardinal wall; `PhysicsWorld::
  standard_arena` carries exactly 8 curves, plus — the real end-to-end
  proof — a ball resting at ordinary flat-floor height within a curve's
  footprint (already overlapping the fillet's own material) gets pushed up
  off that flat height instead of staying embedded, while a car in the
  exact same position stays completely unaffected at its ordinary
  flat-floor resting height.

## Modeled arena footprint
**2026-08-30** · [#47](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/47) · `cc68213`

- **Added:** a new `arena` module builds Rocket League's real
  standard-arena boundary entirely from `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-013`'s existing
  generic `StaticPlane`/`PhysicsWorld::with_wall` machinery
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-019`) — no new collision code, since a ceiling and a
  corner-cut wall are each just another flat plane.
- **`arena::standard_ground`** is the flat floor at `z = 0`, identical to
  the `flat_ground()` test helper this crate has used since v0.
- **`arena::standard_walls`** returns 9 `StaticPlane`s: 2 side walls
  (`x = ±SIDE_WALL_X`), 2 back walls (`y = ±BACK_WALL_Y`), a ceiling
  (`z = CEILING_Z`), and 4 diagonal corner walls (one per quadrant) cutting
  off the true rectangular corner where a side wall would otherwise meet a
  back wall at 90 degrees — giving the field its real octagonal footprint
  instead of a plain rectangle.
- **Constant sourcing:** `SIDE_WALL_X` (4096), `BACK_WALL_Y` (5120), and
  `CEILING_Z` (2044) are commonly-cited community-measured field
  dimensions, the same sourcing convention `drive::MAX_CAR_SPEED`/
  `JUMP_SPEED` already established. The corner walls' inset distance
  (`CORNER_LENGTH`, equal along both axes, giving a 45-degree cut) is this
  project's own uncalibrated placeholder — this port has no verified
  reference for the real arena's actual corner-wall geometry, which isn't
  even a single flat plane in the real field mesh (it's curved, and blends
  into ramps this port doesn't model either).
- **New `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` convenience constructor** wires
  both into a `PhysicsWorld` in one call — offered alongside, not
  replacing, `PhysicsWorld::new`/`with_wall`'s existing ad-hoc-wall
  capability, which this crate's own tests keep using for non-standard
  scenes.
- **Still not modeled:** curved wall-to-floor/wall-to-ceiling transitions,
  goal cutouts in the back walls, and disambiguating or blending a car's
  simultaneous contact with two walls at a corner for wall-jump purposes —
  physical collision resolution already handles a car touching two walls
  at once correctly regardless (each wall is resolved independently every
  step), only the wall-jump push-off direction picker still isn't, and
  the new corner walls make that case reachable in the standard arena for
  the first time (still untested here).
- 10 new unit tests across `arena.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet`
  (153 total): `standard_walls` returns exactly 9 planes; the arena's
  center is on the playable side of every one of them; opposing side/back
  walls share one offset magnitude by construction; a point just past a
  side wall is no longer on the playable side; the ceiling bounds from
  above; a corner wall actually cuts off the true rectangular corner; all
  four corner walls share one offset magnitude, plus — the real end-to-end
  proof — `PhysicsWorld::standard_arena` carries exactly 9 walls and the
  standard ground, a ball shot at the standard arena's side wall bounces
  off it rather than escaping, and a ball fired straight at the true
  rectangular corner is stopped by the diagonal corner wall well before
  its x or y individually reaches either the side or back wall's own
  position.

## Landing auto-orientation
**2026-08-30** · [#45](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/45) · `b5ed2cd`

- **Added:** `drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a gentle continuous
  restoring torque, applied while airborne, nudging the car's local up
  axis back toward world up (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-018`). Real Rocket League
  triggers this assist on approach to the ground; this port has no
  raycast or distance query to replicate that condition, so the assist
  instead applies continuously whenever airborne, gated on two conditions
  so it never fights the player: no active `pitch`/`roll` air-control
  input this step, and no fresh `ControllerInput.jump` press this step
  (avoiding a same-step conflict between this torque's accumulation into
  `total_torque` and a dodge's/wall-jump-dodge's/double-jump's/
  flip-cancel's own direct `angular_velocity` mutation, both resolved by
  the same `integrate_velocities` call).
- **The correction:** `up_axis(car).cross(&world_up) *
  LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`. Since both vectors are unit length, the
  cross product's magnitude is already proportional to the sine of the
  car's tilt off level, so a level car earns no correction and a heavily
  tilted one earns a proportionally stronger nudge, with no separate angle
  computation needed.
- **New constant `LANDING_AUTO_UPRIGHT_TORQUE`** is an uncalibrated
  placeholder, deliberately one full order of magnitude smaller than
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` so the assist reads as gentle assistance, not full
  control — this port has no public reference for the real assist's
  actual strength or trigger condition either.
- **Known, accepted, unaddressed limitation:** a car resting exactly
  upside-down gives an exactly antiparallel `up_axis`/`world_up` pair,
  whose cross product is also zero, so no correction is computed in that
  unlikely exact singularity.
- **No new `PhysicsWorld` state** — the assist is a pure function of the
  car's current orientation, input, and ground contact, all already in
  scope.
- Drive.rs's own test-helper chain never calls
  `integrate::integrate_transform`, so a car's `orientation` never
  actually changes step-to-step there; the new `drive.rs` tests instead
  set a known tilted orientation directly (a new `tilted_car()` helper)
  and check a single step's resulting torque.
- A pre-existing regression test
  (`world::tests::landing_and_a_new_double_jump_clears_a_stale_dodge_flip_
  flag_in_a_live_world`) was loosened from an exact `assert_eq!` to a
  small tolerance, since the assist now legitimately nudges angular
  velocity by a tiny amount on the test's intervening neutral-input step.
- 5 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (143
  total): a tilted airborne car with no input gets a corrective torque; an
  already-upright airborne car gets none; the assist has no effect while
  grounded; it doesn't fire while pitch air control is actively held; and
  — the real end-to-end proof — a car tilted 90 degrees with no input
  trends back toward level over 120 steps of a live `PhysicsWorld::step`
  loop (gravity zeroed). This closes out the last item tracked in
  `drive.rs`'s own module doc "Not implemented" list since the dodge
  (FR-014) increment — that list is now empty.

## Wall-jump dodge
**2026-08-30** · [#43](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/43) · `3b08fdf`

- **Added:** the wall jump's own fresh press (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-013`) now
  checks `ControllerInput.pitch`/`roll` against `DODGE_DEADZONE`
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-017`), the same check the ground double jump's press
  already uses (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-014`): at or above it on either axis, a
  **wall-jump dodge** fires instead of the plain fixed push-off — the same
  outward-plus-upward impulse combined with a horizontal `DODGE_SPEED`
  component and `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` spin (identical axis/sign conventions
  to the ground dodge), also arming `dodge_flip_active` so its spin is
  flip-cancelable exactly like a ground dodge's (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`).
- **Below the deadzone:** the plain wall jump fires exactly as before this
  requirement, still never touching `double_jump_available`.
- **Unlike the plain wall jump, the dodge variant spends the double jump:**
  a deliberate simplification — since touching a wall unconditionally
  restores `double_jump_available` before this check ever runs, gating the
  dodge variant on it would be vacuous (always true there); having it
  consume the resource instead keeps flip-cancel's existing invariant
  ("`dodge_flip_active` is only ever true while `double_jump_available` is
  false") intact with zero changes to flip-cancel's own branch ordering or
  any new landing/wall-touch-clearing logic. This port has no way to
  separately account for "a wall touch refilled the double jump, then the
  wall-jump dodge spent it" versus a genuinely independent wall-dash
  resource, and real Rocket League's precise accounting here isn't public
  to the precision this project would need to model that distinction.
- **No new physics constants** — reuses
  `DODGE_SPEED`/`DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED`/`WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED`/
  `JUMP_SPEED` outright.
- **Two pre-existing tests repurposed, not silently deleted:**
  `drive::wall_jump_fires_instead_of_a_dodge_when_touching_a_wall` and
  `world::wall_jump_still_fires_instead_of_a_dodge_when_touching_a_wall`
  both asserted the *old* "wall jump always ignores stick input" premise
  this requirement deliberately reverses — both now assert the new
  wall-jump-dodge behavior instead, keeping the same scenario (touching a
  wall with directional stick input) but updating the expected outcome.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (138
  total): a wall-jump dodge consumes the double jump unlike a plain wall
  jump; its spin can be flip-cancelled; a below-deadzone stick deflection
  still gives a plain wall jump; opposite stick sign dodges the opposite
  direction; a diagonal (pitch+roll) wall-jump dodge combines both axes,
  plus — the real end-to-end proof — a wall-jump dodge firing in a live
  `PhysicsWorld::step` loop, and a second end-to-end test confirming its
  spin is flip-cancelable there too.

---

## Flip-cancel
**2026-08-30** · [#41](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/41) · `14d986d`

- **Added:** a dodge's spin (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-014`) can now be canceled
  early (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-016`) — a further fresh `ControllerInput.jump`
  press while airborne, not touching a wall, with the double jump already
  spent by that dodge, zeroes `RigidBody.angular_velocity` outright instead
  of leaving the flip to spin indefinitely.
- **A new per-car `dodge_flip_active: bool`** (`PhysicsWorld`'s parallel
  `car_dodge_flip_active: Vec<bool>`, starting `false`) tracks whether the
  most recent double-jump-or-dodge press left a cancelable flip: the
  directional-dodge branch sets it `true`; the plain-double-jump branch
  explicitly sets it `false` rather than leaving it alone.
- **Closes a real staleness bug this port's own tests were written to
  catch:** without that explicit clear, a much-later, completely unrelated
  plain double jump (after landing from the dodge and taking off again)
  would leave the flag `true`, letting a further press spuriously
  flip-cancel a flip that no longer exists. Verified by temporarily
  removing the fix and confirming both the `drive.rs` and `world.rs`
  regression tests actually fail without it.
- **Scoped narrowly:** flip-cancel touches neither the dodge's own linear
  velocity nor `double_jump_available` (already spent by the dodge that set
  the flag); wall jump keeps its existing priority, checked first in the
  airborne branch, unchanged. This port has no timed flip animation to
  interrupt (a dodge is one instantaneous angular-velocity kick, not a
  sustained torque over a fixed duration), so "mid-flip" here means "any
  time before landing or a wall touch re-arms the double jump" — a
  documented simplification of real Rocket League's actual flip-duration
  window. No new physics constants — a state-flag-gated zeroing action, not
  a magnitude to calibrate.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (132
  total): a second jump press cancels a dodge's spin outright and spends
  the flag; flip-cancel leaves the dodge's own translation and
  `double_jump_available` untouched; a plain double jump clears a stale
  `dodge_flip_active` left over from an earlier dodge; a wall jump still
  takes priority over flip-cancel when touching a wall, plus — the real
  end-to-end proof — a second jump press canceling a dodge's spin in a live
  `PhysicsWorld::step` loop, and a regression test confirming landing and a
  later plain double jump clear a stale flag there too, not just in
  `drive.rs` isolation.

## Variable jump height input
**2026-08-30** · [#39](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/39) · `9266c6c`

- **Added:** the ground jump (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-010`) gains a hold window
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-015`) — continuing to hold `ControllerInput.jump`
  after the fresh press that fires it adds a continuous
  `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION` upward force, for up to
  `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION` seconds, on top of the press's own fixed
  `JUMP_SPEED` impulse. Releasing `jump` (or the window simply running
  out) stops the extra acceleration immediately, matching real Rocket
  League's held-vs-tapped jump height difference.
- **Ordering-sensitive by design:** a new per-car `jump_hold_time_remaining:
  f32` (`PhysicsWorld`'s parallel `car_jump_hold_time_remaining: Vec<f32>`,
  starting `0.0`) is checked and decremented against whatever value the
  *previous* call left it at, before that same call's own
  `on_ground`/`jump_pressed` handling can re-arm it to
  `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION` — so a fresh ground-jump press's own step
  always fires only the plain impulse; only continued holding into later
  calls earns the extra height.
- **Scoped to the ground jump alone:** the double jump, a dodge, and the
  wall jump are all still a single fixed instantaneous impulse, unaffected
  by how long jump is held — firing any of them requires releasing jump
  first (a fresh press), which itself unconditionally zeroes the ground
  jump's hold window before that press's own branch ever runs.
- **Constants:** `JUMP_HOLD_MAX_DURATION` and `JUMP_HOLD_ACCELERATION` are
  both uncalibrated placeholders — this port has no public reference for
  real Rocket League's actual hold-window length or acceleration the way
  `JUMP_SPEED` does.
- **Regression fix:** the pre-existing
  `holding_jump_does_not_repeatedly_relaunch_the_car` test's run duration
  was extended (1.5s → 3.0s), since a continuously held jump now also
  earns the variable-height bonus, climbing higher and taking longer to
  land than a bare `JUMP_SPEED` impulse alone.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (126
  total): holding jump after a ground jump adds more upward velocity than
  tapping it, releasing jump early stops the extra acceleration
  immediately, the extra acceleration stops accruing once the hold window
  has expired even if still held, and a double jump fired after holding
  the ground jump through its whole window still adds exactly one more
  `JUMP_SPEED` kick rather than an extra variable-height boost, plus — the
  real end-to-end proof — a held ground jump reaching a greater peak
  height than a tapped one in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop, and a
  regression test confirming the double-jump-unaffected property holds
  there too, not just in `drive.rs` isolation.

---

## Dodge input
**2026-08-30** · [#37](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/37) · `72150f5`

- **Added:** the double jump's fresh press (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-014`) now
  checks `ControllerInput.pitch`/`roll` at the moment it fires: at or above
  a new `DODGE_DEADZONE` on either axis, it fires a directional dodge
  instead of the plain vertical double jump — a purely horizontal
  `DODGE_SPEED` impulse (along `forward_axis` for `pitch`, `right_axis`
  for `roll`) plus an instantaneous `DODGE_ANGULAR_SPEED` spin written
  directly to `RigidBody.angular_velocity` about the perpendicular axis.
- **Reuses air control's own axis/sign conventions:** a forward dodge uses
  the same `pitch`→`right_axis` mapping air control's pitch torque already
  does (just fast and instantaneous instead of a continuous torque), and a
  side dodge does the same with `roll`→`forward_axis`. Both axes can
  contribute at once (a diagonal dodge), simply summed rather than
  normalized — a documented simplification, since real Rocket League
  normalizes the stick direction so a diagonal dodge isn't faster than an
  axis-aligned one.
- **Shares the double jump's resource:** below `DODGE_DEADZONE` on both
  axes, the plain vertical double jump fires exactly as before; either way
  the press spends the shared `double_jump_available` — a dodge and a
  plain double jump aren't separate resources. Wall jump is untouched: it
  never checks `pitch`/`roll` at all, so touching a wall always gets the
  fixed wall-jump push-off, never a dodge.
- **Constants:** `DODGE_SPEED` and `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` are now
  `pub` (mirroring `JUMP_SPEED`) so `world.rs`'s end-to-end tests can
  assert against, and distinguish between, all three jump variants.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): a dodge variant
  of the wall jump, canceling a dodge's rotation early by pressing again
  mid-flip (flip-cancel), any landing auto-orientation assistance, and
  variable jump height — each tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 10 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet`
  (120 total): a forward (pitch) dodge and a lateral (roll) dodge each
  give the expected horizontal velocity and spin, a below-deadzone
  deflection still gives a plain double jump, a dodge spends
  `double_jump_available` the same as a plain one, opposite pitch dodges
  the opposite direction, a diagonal dodge combines both axes, dodge logic
  has no effect while grounded, and a wall jump still fires its own
  (smaller) push-off instead of a dodge when touching a wall, plus — the
  real end-to-end proof — a car dodging forward with a visible flip after
  a ground jump in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop, and a regression test
  confirming a car touching a wall with directional stick input still
  gets the wall jump, not a dodge.

---

## Wall jump input
**2026-08-30** · [#35](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/35) · `b748b86`

- **Added:** `PhysicsWorld` gains arena walls (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-013`) —
  `walls: Vec<StaticPlane>` and a `with_wall` builder (mirroring
  `with_car`). Every body (ball and cars alike) now collides with every
  wall the same way it already collides with the ground, reusing the same
  body-vs-static-plane machinery (`resolve_ground_contact` is renamed
  `resolve_plane_contact` — no behavior change, it never had ground-specific
  logic, just a ground-specific name).
- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a wall
  jump — a fresh airborne jump press while touching a wall
  (`wall_normal: Some(normal)`, computed the same way `on_ground` is) fires
  an impulse combining a new `WALL_JUMP_HORIZONTAL_SPEED` (uncalibrated
  placeholder) outward along the wall's normal with `JUMP_SPEED` upward.
- **Interaction with the double jump:** wall jump takes priority over the
  double jump on a fresh press, but is otherwise independent of it —
  merely touching a wall (whether or not jump is pressed) unconditionally
  restores `double_jump_available`, the same "any surface contact refills
  your second jump" rule landing already uses, so a wall jump doesn't cost
  a player their double jump and has no once-per-airborne-period limit of
  its own.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): the directional
  "dodge" a real wall jump can pair with, variable jump height, and any
  modeled arena footprint beyond generic flat walls (Rocket League's actual
  octagonal shape, curved wall-to-floor/ceiling transitions, a ceiling, or
  disambiguating a car touching two walls at once) — each tracked as
  separate follow-up work.
- 7 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet`
  (110 total): wall jump gives outward-and-upward velocity when available,
  has no effect while grounded, takes priority over the double jump
  without consuming it, and mere wall contact restores double-jump
  availability, plus — the real end-to-end proof — a car resting against a
  wall wall-jumps outward and upward in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop,
  a ball shot at a wall bounces off it instead of tunnelling through (the
  same physical proof ball-vs-car collision already has, now for the
  generic plane-collision machinery walls reuse), and a regression test
  confirming a car near but not touching an existing wall still gets a
  plain double jump.

---

## Double jump input
**2026-08-30** · [#33](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/33) · `7c9524a`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a
  double jump (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-012`) — one more, identical `JUMP_SPEED`
  instantaneous upward velocity change fired on a fresh (rising-edge)
  press of `ControllerInput.jump` while the car is airborne, reusing the
  ground jump's own edge detection rather than a second edge-detector.
- **Availability, not ground contact:** gated on a new per-car
  `double_jump_available` flag instead of `on_ground` — touching the
  ground (landing, or simply resting) unconditionally restores it to
  `true`, and a fresh airborne press that fires the double jump sets it to
  `false` until the next landing, so it fires at most once per airborne
  period no matter how many more times jump is released and re-pressed
  before then. `PhysicsWorld` gains a parallel
  `car_double_jump_available: Vec<bool>` (starting `true`, kept in
  lockstep with `cars` by `with_car`).
- **Constants:** reuses `JUMP_SPEED` (now `pub`) rather than a
  separately-calibrated double-jump speed — this port has no public
  reference for a distinct number either.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): the directional
  "dodge" impulse/torque a real double jump pairs with (a sideways/forward
  flip from the stick direction at the moment of the second press),
  variable jump height, and wall jump — each a distinct real mechanic,
  tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet`,
  minus one pre-existing `drive.rs` test (`jump_has_no_effect_while_airborne`)
  removed because this feature deliberately supersedes its premise (103
  total): a fresh airborne jump press gives upward velocity when the
  double jump is available, has no effect when it isn't, is consumed
  after firing once, and touching the ground restores availability, plus
  — the real end-to-end proof — a double jump fired after a ground jump
  in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop (gravity zeroed) adds a second
  `JUMP_SPEED` kick on top of the first, and a regression test confirming
  a spent double jump doesn't refire mid-air no matter how many more
  times jump is released and re-pressed before landing.

---

## Air control input
**2026-08-29** · [#31](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/31) · `431ff56`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains air
  control (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-011`) — torque about the car's local right,
  up, and forward axes, scaled directly by `ControllerInput.pitch`/`yaw`/
  `roll` (each an `Option<f32>`, `None` treated as zero) times one shared
  `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` constant, applied whenever the car is *not*
  touching the ground — the mirror image of throttle/steering/handbrake/
  jump's ground-only gating, so it never competes with ground steering for
  the yaw axis.
- **Design note:** unlike ground steering, air control isn't speed-scaled
  — a car can spin from a standing start in the air, since there's no
  wheel grip to require momentum for. A new `right_axis` helper completes
  the local (forward, right, up) basis alongside the existing
  `forward_axis`/`up_axis`.
- **Constants, honestly labeled:** `AIR_CONTROL_TORQUE` is an uncalibrated
  placeholder with no public reference at all (like `STEER_TORQUE` and
  `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`), shared uniformly across pitch, yaw,
  and roll — a documented simplification, since real Rocket League's
  three rates differ from each other (roll fastest).
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): double
  jump/dodge, variable jump height (holding jump for a higher jump), and
  wall jump — each a distinct real mechanic, tracked as separate
  follow-up work. Also out of scope: per-axis torque calibration, an "air
  roll only" input mode, camera-relative stick mapping, and any
  auto-orientation assistance on landing.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (98
  total): pitch/yaw/roll each produce angular velocity about the correct
  local axis for a stationary airborne car, air control has no effect
  while grounded, a `None` analog value behaves like neutral input, and
  opposite-sign yaw spins the opposite way, plus — the real end-to-end
  proof — a car with yaw input in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop
  (gravity zeroed) actually reorients itself mid-air, and a regression
  test confirming a grounded car stays level despite stray pitch/yaw/roll
  input.

---

## Jump input
**2026-08-29** · [#29](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/29) · `689b006`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a
  single ground jump (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-010`) — a fixed `JUMP_SPEED`
  instantaneous upward velocity change (via `RigidBody::apply_impulse`,
  not a continuous force) fired on the *rising edge* of
  `ControllerInput.jump` while the car is grounded — a fresh press, not
  merely held.
- **Edge detection:** holding jump through the resulting airborne period
  doesn't re-fire it, and releasing then re-pressing while still airborne
  doesn't fire it either (this increment has no double jump to grant).
  `PhysicsWorld` gains a parallel `car_jump_held: Vec<bool>` (starting
  `false`, kept in lockstep with `cars` by `with_car`) carrying "was jump
  held as of the previous step" across calls — the same pattern
  `boost_amount` already uses for cross-call resource state.
- **Constants, honestly labeled:** `JUMP_SPEED` (292 uu/s) is a
  commonly-cited community number, applied as a flat velocity change
  regardless of the car's mass (matching how the real jump impulse
  doesn't scale with mass either).
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): double
  jump/dodge (a second airborne jump, usually paired with a directional
  impulse/torque), variable jump height (real Rocket League adds extra
  upward accel for as long as jump is held, up to a cap — this port
  always applies the same fixed impulse), wall jump (needs arena walls,
  out of scope), and air control (pitch/yaw/roll torque while airborne) —
  each a distinct real mechanic, tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (92
  total): jump gives a grounded car upward velocity, has no effect while
  airborne, doesn't re-fire on a second call while still held, and fires
  again after a release-then-re-press, plus — the real end-to-end proof —
  a car with jump input in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop actually
  leaves the ground, and a regression test confirming that holding jump
  for a car's entire flight (never released) lets it land and settle
  instead of being relaunched on touchdown.

---

## Handbrake input
**2026-08-29** · [#27](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/27) · `56f9cb4`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a
  handbrake mechanic (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-009`) — while
  `ControllerInput.handbrake` is held and the car is grounded (gated like
  throttle/steering — a free-floating box has no wheels to lock), the
  car's `RigidBody.friction` is temporarily multiplied by a new
  `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER`, letting the car's existing momentum
  carry it into a slide instead of gripping the ground and turning
  cleanly. Releasing handbrake restores the car's own friction.
- **Design note:** this reuses the ground-contact solver's existing
  Coulomb-friction machinery rather than inventing a separate lateral-slip
  system — this port has no per-wheel tire model, so there's no
  rear-specific grip to lose the way a real car's handbrake works. A
  uniform, temporary reduction of the whole car's one friction value is a
  deliberately simple stand-in, not a claim of mechanistic fidelity.
- **Added:** `PhysicsWorld` gains a parallel `car_base_friction: Vec<f32>`,
  snapshotted from each car's own constructed `friction` by `with_car`, so
  handbrake restores the car's own base value on release — not some
  crate-wide default, even when a car was built with a custom friction.
- **Constants, honestly labeled:** `HANDBRAKE_FRICTION_MULTIPLIER` is an
  uncalibrated placeholder with no public reference at all (like
  `STEER_TORQUE`), chosen only to produce a visibly reduced (not zero)
  grip in tests.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): jump and air
  control (pitch/yaw/roll torque while airborne) — each a distinct real
  mechanic, tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 5 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (86
  total): handbrake reduces friction while grounded, has no effect while
  airborne, and releasing it restores the car's base friction; releasing
  handbrake restores a car's own *non-default* base friction (not a
  hardcoded constant); and — the real end-to-end proof — a car already
  sliding sideways in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop retains more of
  that slide under handbrake's reduced friction than under normal grip.

---

## Boost input
**2026-08-29** · [#25](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/25) · `40e70cd`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive::apply_driven_forces` gains a boost
  force (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-008`) — a flat forward force
  (`BOOST_ACCELERATION * mass`, not speed-tapered like throttle, capped at
  the same `MAX_CAR_SPEED` ceiling) applied whenever
  `ControllerInput.boost` is set and the car has boost remaining. Unlike
  throttle and steering, boost is **not** gated on ground contact — it's
  modeled as a rocket, not an engine, so it works identically airborne,
  matching real Rocket League.
- **Added:** `PhysicsWorld::set_car_boost`, setting a car's current boost
  amount directly. `PhysicsWorld` gains a parallel `car_boost: Vec<f32>`
  (kept in lockstep with `cars` by `with_car`, starting at a full tank —
  `drive::MAX_BOOST`). Holding boost input drains the tank at
  `BOOST_CONSUMPTION_RATE` per second whenever held, even once the forward
  force itself stops applying at `MAX_CAR_SPEED` — matching real Rocket
  League's "holding boost drains fuel regardless of whether it's still
  accelerating you" — clamping at zero (no effect once empty).
- **Changed:** `frame()` now reports each car's actual live `boost_amount`
  instead of a hardcoded `0.0`.
- **Constants, honestly labeled:** `MAX_CAR_SPEED`, `MAX_BOOST` (100, a
  full tank), and `BOOST_ACCELERATION` (~991.667 uu/s^2) are commonly-cited
  community numbers (the same body of public research `PhysicsWorld`'s
  gravity constant comes from); `BOOST_CONSUMPTION_RATE` is this project's
  own simplified constant approximating "a full tank lasts roughly 3
  seconds" rather than Rocket League's real drain curve. Reusing
  `MAX_CAR_SPEED` as boost's speed cap too (real Rocket League doesn't
  share one ceiling between throttle and boost) is a documented
  simplification — see the spec's Open questions.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): jump, air
  control (pitch/yaw/roll torque while airborne), and handbrake/drift —
  each a distinct real mechanic, tracked as separate follow-up work.
- 6 new unit tests across `drive.rs`/`world.rs` in `rb_physics_bullet` (81
  total): boost accelerates a car regardless of ground contact, drains the
  tank over time and clamps at zero, has no effect once the tank is empty,
  and still drains the tank even once the car is at `MAX_CAR_SPEED` and the
  forward force stops applying, plus — the real end-to-end proof — a car
  given full boost input with gravity zeroed in a live `PhysicsWorld::step`
  loop actually drives forward while airborne, and a regression test
  confirming a new car starts with a full boost tank.

## Driven car input (ground throttle and steering)
**2026-08-29** · [#23](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/23) · `f1a0381`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet::drive`, coupling `rb_domain::ControllerInput`
  into a throttle force (along the car's local forward axis, capped at
  `MAX_CAR_SPEED`) and a steering torque (about the car's local up axis,
  scaled by current speed so a stationary car can't turn in place) —
  `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-007`. Both are gated on the car actually touching the
  ground; a free-floating car has no wheels to grip, so airborne input
  does nothing yet.
- **Added:** `PhysicsWorld::set_car_input`, setting a car's current
  `ControllerInput`, which persists across steps until changed again
  (matching how a real controller's state holds between frames).
  `PhysicsWorld::step` computes each car's ground-contact state up front
  and applies its driven forces alongside gravity, before integrating
  velocities.
- **Changed:** `frame()` now reports each car's actual driving input
  (`Some(input)`) instead of always `None`.
- **Constants, honestly labeled:** `MAX_CAR_SPEED` (2300 uu/s) is a
  commonly-cited community number (the same body of public research
  `PhysicsWorld`'s gravity constant comes from); `THROTTLE_ACCELERATION`
  is this project's own simplified constant standing in for Rocket
  League's real speed-dependent throttle curve; `STEER_TORQUE` is an
  uncalibrated placeholder with no public reference at all, chosen only to
  produce a visibly responsive turn in tests.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): boost, jump, air
  control (pitch/yaw/roll torque while airborne), and handbrake/drift —
  each a distinct real mechanic, tracked as separate follow-up work. A car
  with no input set behaves exactly as a free rigid box always has.
- 10 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet` (75 total): a neutral input is
  a no-op, throttle accelerates/caps-at-max-speed/reverses/is
  grounded-only, steering is speed-gated (a parked car can't turn) and
  sign-correct, and — the real end-to-end proof — a car given throttle
  input in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop actually drives forward across
  the ground, plus a regression test confirming a car with no input set is
  unaffected.

## Multi-car PhysicsWorld support
**2026-08-29** · [#21](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/21) · `28b8d4c`

- **Changed (breaking):** `PhysicsWorld.car: Option<RigidBody>` is
  replaced by `cars: Vec<RigidBody>`. `with_car` now appends, so calling
  it repeatedly builds a scene with any number of cars —
  `PhysicsWorld::new(ball, ground).with_car(a).with_car(b)` is a two-car
  scene. No cap is imposed by this crate (Rocket League's real 8-car limit
  is a gameplay rule, not a physics-core one).
- **Changed:** `PhysicsWorld::step` now resolves every car's ground
  contact, every ball-vs-car pair, and every car-vs-car pair each step —
  `collision::box_vs_box` (added in the previous release but with no live
  caller) now runs for real in a live scene, one pair at a time, not just
  under a unit test. `frame()` assigns each car's `player_id` as its index
  in `cars`.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): a combined
  multi-body solve — each pair is still resolved independently, its own
  full solver pass, rather than one simultaneous solve across every
  contact touching in the same step. This is a real approximation once 3+
  bodies are mutually touching at once (e.g. a car pinned between the ball
  and another car); driven car input also remains not implemented.
- 3 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet` (65 total): `with_car` called
  twice builds a two-car scene, `frame()` assigns sequential `player_id`s
  across multiple cars, and — the real end-to-end proof — two cars shot
  head-on at each other in a live `PhysicsWorld::step` loop actually
  bounce off each other instead of tunnelling through.

## Car-vs-car collision detection
**2026-08-29** · [#19](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/19) · `2eddfe7`

- **Added:** `collision::box_vs_box`, a general separating-axis test
  (SAT) between two oriented boxes (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-006`) — 3+3 face
  axes plus 9 edge-pair cross-product axes, the same overall structure as
  `btBoxBoxDetector::dBoxBox`. When every axis shows overlap, the
  minimum-penetration axis becomes the contact normal; a face axis
  produces a clipped face manifold (0-4 points, via a box-specific closed
  form of incident-face-vs-reference-face clipping), an edge axis a
  single edge-edge point (via a standard closest-point-between-segments
  construction).
- **Changed:** `collision::contact_between` is renamed `contacts_between`
  and now returns `Vec<Contact>` uniformly (previously `Option<Contact>`)
  — needed since box-vs-box can return a manifold where sphere-vs-box
  always returned at most one point. `solver::resolve_contact_between` is
  similarly generalized to `resolve_contacts_between`, resolving an entire
  manifold between two dynamic bodies (mirroring `resolve_contacts`'
  existing multi-contact structure for one body vs. a static plane) rather
  than a single contact.
- **Not wired up** (explicitly, not silently dropped): `PhysicsWorld`
  still models exactly one ball and one optional car, so `box_vs_box` has
  no live caller in a real simulated scene — a second car colliding with
  the first never actually happens yet. Wiring it in needs multi-car
  `PhysicsWorld` support, a distinct, larger scope decision tracked as
  separate follow-up work, not this change's scope.
- 4 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet` (62 total): no contact for
  far-apart boxes, a 4-point manifold with correct depth/normal for a
  symmetric flat overlap, argument-order antisymmetry (matching the
  sphere-vs-box convention), a partial manifold for a non-flat rotated
  overlap, and (in `solver`) a generalized `resolve_contacts_between`
  settling two colliding boxes' face-to-face manifold without spurious net
  rotation — the same property already verified for the one-body
  ground-manifold case.

---

## Ball-vs-car collision
**2026-08-28** · [#17](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/17) · `2f12c8f`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet` gains analytic sphere-vs-box contact
  generation (`collision::sphere_vs_box`, dispatched via
  `collision::contact_between`) completing `RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-004` — the
  ball and car now actually collide with each other, not just the ground.
  A closed-form closest-point-on-box query handles the ordinary case; a
  second case handles the sphere's center already being inside the box
  (deep penetration), pushing out through whichever face is nearest.
- **Added:** a two-dynamic-body sequential-impulse solver path
  (`solver::resolve_contact_between`), generalizing the existing
  body-vs-static-plane constraint rows to carry both bodies' mass/inertia
  contributions — the generic path Bullet's real solver always runs
  (`resolve_contacts`'s one-body-only shortcut only worked because a
  static plane's side of that math is always zero).
- **Added:** `rb_domain::Quat::conjugate` (`btQuaternion::inverse`),
  needed to transform a world-space point into a rotated box's local
  frame.
- **Changed:** `PhysicsWorld::step` is restructured into Bullet's actual
  staged pipeline — integrate every body's velocity, then resolve every
  contact (ground contacts for each body, then the one ball-vs-car
  contact), then integrate every body's transform — instead of stepping
  each body fully in isolation, so ball-vs-car resolution sees the same
  pre-integration state ground contacts do.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): box-vs-box
  collision (two cars against each other) — this scope has exactly one
  car, so it never arises; driven car input remains a free rigid box with
  nothing coupling throttle/steer/boost into it.
- 11 new unit tests in `rb_physics_bullet` (58 total) and 1 in `rb_domain`
  (23 total), including an end-to-end `PhysicsWorld::step` test confirming
  a ball shot at a stationary car actually bounces off it instead of
  tunnelling through, and solver tests confirming the two-body path
  conserves linear momentum and leaves a much heavier body barely moving
  from a much lighter body's impact.

## Box-shaped car bodies
**2026-08-28** · [#15](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/15) · `24468cf`

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet` gains a unified `RigidBody`/`Shape`
  design (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-004`) — one rigid-body type serving both the
  ball (sphere) and a car (box), matching Bullet's own architecture
  (`btRigidBody` plus a polymorphic `btCollisionShape`) rather than a
  separate type per shape. `Sphere` is gone; `RigidBody::sphere(...)` and
  `RigidBody::car_box(half_extents, ...)` are the new constructors.
- **Added:** `Mat3`, a general 3x3 matrix (ported from
  `btMatrix3x3::setRotation`/`scaled`) — needed because a box's inertia
  tensor is anisotropic, unlike a sphere's isotropic (scalar) one.
  `RigidBody` now carries `inv_inertia_local` (diagonal, body frame) and
  recomputes a full `inv_inertia_world` matrix each step
  (`update_inertia_tensor`) from the body's current orientation. A
  sphere's `inv_inertia_world` is mathematically orientation-independent,
  so this is a strict generalization — sphere behavior is unchanged.
- **Added:** analytic box-vs-plane contact generation — tests all 8
  corners against the plane (exact for a box vs. an infinite plane, not
  an approximation), producing 1 to 4 contacts depending on orientation
  (4 resting flat, 2 on an edge, 1 on a corner).
- **Added:** multi-contact manifold resolution — the solver now resolves
  an entire manifold (`resolve_contacts`, 1-4 points) together each
  iteration, sharing one accumulated velocity delta, instead of one
  contact at a time. A box dropped flat settles without spuriously
  tipping onto an edge — verified by a dedicated test.
- **Added:** `PhysicsWorld::with_car`, an optional car body stepped and
  collided against the ground independently from the ball.
- **Not implemented** (explicitly, not silently dropped): box-vs-sphere
  (car-vs-ball) collision — the two bodies never collide with each other
  yet, needing a real convex narrow-phase algorithm (SAT or GJK/EPA);
  driven car input — a car here is a free rigid box, nothing couples
  throttle/steer/boost into it; constant calibration
  (`RB-PHYSICS-001-FR-005`) still needs real `PHASE-0-EXIT` data.
- **Verified:** 21 new unit tests (47 total in `rb_physics_bullet`, 96 in
  the workspace): box inertia formula, orientation-dependent inertia
  (unlike a sphere's), box-vs-plane contact counts for flat/edge/corner/
  embedded cases, a box in free-fall matching the same kinematics as a
  sphere, and — the key multi-contact regression test — a box dropped
  flat settling on the ground without tipping over or accumulating
  spurious spin.
- 21 new unit tests; `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Timestamp-tolerant alignment
**2026-08-28** · [#13](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/13) (merge commit `59266ea`)

- **Added:** `rb_domain::divergence::score` now aligns frames by nearest
  `timestamp_secs` instead of list index (`RB-VERIFY-003-FR-003`) — an
  `O(recorded.len() + candidate.len())` merge over both sequences'
  existing chronological order, not a binary search per frame. A match
  only counts if the two frames' timestamps are within a new required
  `max_timestamp_delta_secs` parameter; a recorded frame with nothing
  that close on the candidate side is skipped, not force-matched to the
  nearest-but-still-distant option. `DivergenceScore.frames_compared`'s
  meaning changes accordingly: it's no longer capped at
  `min(recorded.len(), candidate.len())` — a much shorter candidate
  sequence can now be matched against every recorded frame within
  tolerance of it.
- **Added:** `rb_verify_cli::DEFAULT_MAX_TIMESTAMP_DELTA_SECS` (0.02s,
  reasoned from the vendored replay fixture's own ~0.036s average
  sampling interval, not yet empirically tuned) and an optional third
  `rb-verify` CLI argument to override it.
- **Fixed:** implementing real timestamp alignment surfaced an actual bug
  in `rb_capture_ingest`'s synthetic fixture — its timestamps started at
  `0.0`, but the vendored replay fixture's ball doesn't produce a frame
  until roughly **11.78 seconds** in (kickoff countdown; frames before the
  ball spawns are omitted by design). The old index-pairwise comparison
  silently compared these temporally unrelated frames anyway, since it
  only ever looked at list position — exactly the failure mode FR-003
  exists to catch. Corrected the fixture's timestamps to actually overlap
  the replay's real timeline.
- **Verified:** 2 new unit tests in `rb_domain::divergence` (different
  tick rates aligning correctly with hand-computed expected matches; a
  shorter candidate sequence still matching every in-tolerance recorded
  frame). One existing test was replaced since its premise — sequence
  length alone caps how many frames compare — no longer holds. Manually
  re-run end-to-end against the corrected fixtures (default 0.02s
  tolerance): `frames compared: 6, mean ball distance: 0.25 uu, max ball
  distance: 0.25 uu, car pairs compared: 6, mean car
  position/rotation/velocity distance: 2816.42 uu / 2.36 rad / 1307.87
  uu/s`. `RB-VERIFY-003` now has all three functional requirements
  implemented.
- 2 new unit tests (75 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Car-state divergence scoring
**2026-08-28** · [#11](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/11) (merge commit `a1b8a47`)

- **Added:** `rb_domain::divergence::DivergenceScore` gains a `cars:
  CarDivergence` field — mean/max car position distance, rotation distance
  (radians), and velocity distance, plus the number of car pairs compared
  (`RB-VERIFY-003-FR-002`). Cars are matched between the recorded and
  candidate sequences by `player_id` within each frame pair; a car present
  on only one side of a pair is skipped for that frame, not an error.
- **Added:** `Quat::angle_to` (`rb_domain::state`) — the angle between two
  rotations, in radians. Uses an `atan2`-based half-angle formula rather
  than the more obvious `2.0 * dot.acos()`: `acos` is numerically unstable
  exactly where this metric cares most (near-identical rotations, where a
  tiny `f32` rounding difference would otherwise produce a spuriously
  large angle). Handles the quaternion double-cover (`q` and `-q` are the
  same rotation) via the dot product's absolute value.
- **Changed:** `rb-verify`'s output now prints car-pair count and
  position/rotation/velocity stats alongside the existing ball stats.
- **Verified:** 8 new unit tests in `rb_domain` (4 car-scoring cases: 
  identical states, known position/velocity offsets, a known rotation
  offset, a car unmatched on one side; 3 for `angle_to`). Manually re-run
  end-to-end against the same real replay fixture + synthetic capture
  fixture: `car pairs compared: 5, mean car position/rotation/velocity
  distance: 2823.85 uu / 2.36 rad / 1369.44 uu/s`. As before, these
  numbers are not a fidelity signal — the two fixtures are unrelated
  matches — they only confirm car scoring runs correctly end-to-end.
- 8 new unit tests (73 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Divergence scoring CLI wiring
**2026-08-28** · [#9](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/9) (merge commit `f10d017`)

- **Added:** `rb_verify_cli::score_replay_against_capture` (new `lib.rs`)
  — the actual composition-root wiring, ingesting a replay via
  `rb_replay_ingest` and a capture via `rb_capture_ingest` and running
  `rb_domain::divergence::score` on the results. `main.rs` is now a thin
  argument-parsing/output wrapper over it, kept separate so the wiring
  itself is unit-testable without spawning a process.
- **Changed:** `rb-verify`'s output is now a small human-readable summary
  (frames compared, mean/max ball distance) instead of a raw `Debug` dump.
- **Verified:** 3 new unit tests against `rb_replay_ingest`'s vendored
  replay fixture and `rb_capture_ingest`'s synthetic capture fixture
  (happy path, missing-replay, missing-capture). Manually run end-to-end:
  `frames compared: 5, mean ball distance: 0.25 uu, max ball distance:
  0.25 uu`. This proves the ingest → score pipeline runs without erroring
  across both real adapters — explicitly **not** a fidelity measurement,
  since the replay and capture are unrelated matches and
  `RB-VERIFY-003-FR-002`/`FR-003` (car-state scoring, timestamp-tolerant
  alignment) are still open.
- 3 new unit tests (66 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## BakkesMod capture ingestion — JSON-Lines parser + shared input schema
**2026-08-28** · [#7](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/7) (merge commit `dc7e82f`)

- **Added:** `rb_domain::ControllerInput` and `CarState.input:
  Option<ControllerInput>` (ADR-0005) — a shared controller-input schema
  for both ingestion adapters. `throttle`/`steer` are always a number;
  `pitch`/`yaw`/`roll` are `Option<f32>` since only BakkesMod captures can
  ever populate them (a replay's dodge impulse/torque vectors are a
  different kind of quantity, not an analog stick angle). Resolves
  `RB-VERIFY-001-FR-004`, deferred since replay ingestion landed.
- **Changed:** `rb_replay_ingest::convert` now attaches recovered input
  (throttle/steer normalized from replicated bytes, jump/boost/handbrake
  from `subtr_actor`'s boolean flags) to every car it converts. 4 new unit
  tests (14 total in the crate).
- **Added:** `rb_capture_ingest` now really parses capture files
  (`RB-VERIFY-002-FR-002`/`NFR-001`): the capture format is JSON Lines, one
  `{"timestamp_secs", "ball", "cars"}` object per tick (ADR-0005), decoded
  via a new `wire` module (`serde`/`serde_json`, justified in
  `Cargo.toml`) into `rb_domain::PhysicsFrame`s with every car's `input`
  populated. 10 new unit tests, run against a synthetic, hand-authored
  fixture — see `crates/rb_capture_ingest/fixtures/README.md`.
- **Resolved:** `RB-RESEARCH-O003` (BakkesMod tooling scope) — a one-off
  script writing an unversioned format, not a reusable harness, per
  ADR-0005.
- Known limitation stated plainly, mirroring `RB-RESEARCH-O002`'s own
  practical blocker: the BakkesMod-side plugin that would actually write a
  capture file (`RB-VERIFY-002-FR-001`) has not been built — this
  sandboxed environment has no Rocket League, BakkesMod, or Windows
  environment to build or run it in. `PHASE-0-CAPTURE-INGEST`'s exit gate
  (a real capture, cross-checked against BakkesMod's own overlay) stays
  open until the owner builds and runs that plugin on their own machine.
- 14 new unit tests (63 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Replay ingestion — local real-corpus validation gate
**2026-08-28** · [#5](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/5) (merge commit `0b2253d`)

- **Added:** `corpus_check`, a local/gitignored-corpus health-check binary
  (`cargo run -p rb_replay_ingest --bin corpus_check [dir]`,
  `RB-VERIFY-001-NFR-003`) — runs the real `boxcars` + `subtr-actor` +
  `convert` pipeline against every `.replay` file in a directory (default
  `replays/` at the workspace root, already `.gitignore`d) and exits
  non-zero on any parse failure. A checkout with no corpus present is a
  deliberate no-op, matching `RLEvalSystem`'s own gitignored-corpus
  convention.
- **Verified:** run once against 40 of the owner's own real match replays
  (`baileyrd/replays`) — 40/40 parsed cleanly, durations 19s-717s, 2-11
  players per match, ball Z consistently within plausible soccar bounds.
  Closes the "runs correctly on real owner data at scale" half of
  `RB-VERIFY-001`'s owner-data acceptance criterion; the stricter manual
  single-timestamp cross-check remains open. Marks `PHASE-0-REPLAY-INGEST`
  Done.
- No new dependencies; no `rb_domain`/`rb_replay_ingest` library code
  changed. The owner's real replay files are never committed — only
  aggregate results (counts, ranges) appear in this repo's docs.

## Replay ingestion — boxcars + subtr-actor
**2026-08-28** · [#3](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/3) (merge commit `93ad0e9`)

- **Added:** `rb_replay_ingest` now really parses `.replay` files
  (`RB-VERIFY-001-FR-001/002/003`): `boxcars` parses the raw replay/network
  stream, `subtr-actor` resolves it into frame-indexed ball/car
  `RigidBody` state, and a new `convert.rs` maps that into
  `rb_domain::PhysicsFrame`. Verified end-to-end against a real vendored
  replay fixture (12,029 frames, ~428s match).
- **Added:** `subtr-actor` as a dependency, justified in
  `Cargo.toml` — avoids hand-rolling `boxcars`' actor-graph resolution
  (net-cache/property-id resolution, quantized rotation decoding), a
  substantial and error-prone parsing layer with an existing,
  permissively-licensed, purpose-built solution.
- **Changed:** `RB-RESEARCH-S004`'s "replay input is lossy/inferred at
  best" finding is revised — `subtr-actor` actually recovers raw
  throttle/steer bytes and boost/jump/dodge/powerslide booleans directly
  from the replay's replicated input actor. Still not wired into
  `rb_domain`'s types (`RB-VERIFY-001-FR-004` stays open pending a schema
  decision made jointly with `RB-VERIFY-002`).
- Known limitation stated plainly: the vendored fixture is a third
  party's replay, used only to prove the pipeline runs correctly on real
  bytes — it does not satisfy `RB-VERIFY-001`'s acceptance criterion of a
  manually-verified position check against the owner's own match, since
  this environment has no access to the owner's replay files.
- 10 new unit tests (51 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Physics core v0 — Bullet3 port (sphere vs. ground)
**2026-08-28** · [#1](https://github.com/baileyrd/rusty_bullet/pull/1) (merge commit `7bdc3fc`)

- **Added:** `rb_physics_bullet`, a from-scratch Rust port of specific
  Bullet3 (zlib-licensed) algorithms — rigid-body integration
  (`btRigidBody`) and the sequential-impulse contact solver
  (`btSequentialImpulseConstraintSolver`) — scoped to a dynamic sphere (the
  ball) against a static plane (the ground). Resolves the build-vs-integrate
  physics question via ADR-0004, ahead of `PHASE-0-EXIT` divergence data
  existing, on the strength of Bullet3's direct relevance and permissive
  license.
- **Added:** vector/quaternion algebra (dot, cross, normalize, quaternion
  product/rotation) on `rb_domain`'s `Vec3`/`Quat`, justified by the
  physics crate as a second real consumer.
- Known, deliberate scope cuts stated plainly: no car (box) rigid bodies or
  general 3x3 inertia tensor yet, no split impulse, no warm-starting or
  sleeping — a bouncy (restitution > 0) resting contact does not settle
  under this solver, by design of what v0 covers, not by accident. See
  `RB-PHYSICS-001` and `rb_physics_bullet::solver`'s module doc.
- Also completed the legal/practical review `RB-RESEARCH-O002` (binary
  reverse engineering of the shipped client) needed: Epic/Psyonix's EULA
  and Rocket League's Code of Conduct both contractually prohibit reverse
  engineering, and this sandbox has no access to the game binary regardless
  — still open pending the owner's own legal counsel and sign-off.
- 26 new unit tests (41 total in the workspace); `cargo fmt --check`,
  `clippy -D warnings`, and `cargo test --workspace` all pass.

## Repo bootstrap — full lifecycle baseline
**2026-08-28** · landed directly on `main` at commit `5be2078` (predates this repo's "always PR" convention; no PR exists for it)

- **Added:** Full `rust-repo-lifecycle` + `repo-config` bootstrap: charter,
  system architecture, a 6-spec tree (`RB-VERIFY-001/002/003` fully
  specified for Phase 0; `RB-PHYSICS-001`/`RB-SIM-001`/`RB-NET-001` as
  forward-looking placeholders), 3 ADRs (server-authoritative netcode,
  verification-first ordering, Bullet-fidelity target), a research backlog
  (6 settled findings + 3 tracked open questions), a Phase 0-4 roadmap with
  exit criteria tied to the divergence metric, requirement-level
  traceability, AGENTS.md/WORKFLOW.md, and the standard governance file set
  (README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, CHANGELOG, PR/issue
  templates).
- **Added:** Minimal buildable Cargo workspace — `rb_domain` (physics frame
  types, `PhysicsStateSource` port, divergence-scoring algorithm),
  `rb_replay_ingest`/`rb_capture_ingest` (adapter stubs implementing the
  port), `rb_verify_cli` (composition-root binary). Divergence scoring
  (`RB-VERIFY-003-FR-001`) is real and unit-tested; both ingestion adapters
  are intentionally stubbed (`IngestError::NotImplemented`) — `boxcars`
  parsing and the BakkesMod capture format are Phase 0 delivery work, not
  bootstrap scaffolding.
- Known scope cut, stated plainly: no physics/simulation/netcode code
  exists yet — this PR is the governed baseline the rest of the project
  builds against, per ADR-0002's verification-first ordering.
- 11 unit tests added (6 in `rb_domain`, 1 each in the two adapter stubs,
  plus workspace doc-tests); `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings`, and
  `cargo test --workspace` all pass.
